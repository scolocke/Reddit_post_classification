"I went for a long drive on the weekend, and there was something that troubled me.","I'm Australian, in Australia, specifically southern Australia. Very specifically, southern Victoria. Anyway.
I took a long drive on Friday, iut to Halls Gap, which is a beautiful part of the world. Oddly, I noticed along the way a significant amount of dead crows on the side of the road.
Now I'm of courty stock, and I know well that crows (although technically ravens I believe) are am extraordinarily intelligent bird, and it's very rare that you see one fallen bu the roadside. As such, it was obvious to me as unusual.
So I looked it up, and as it happened there'd been a study conducted regarding the very road I'd driven down. Turns out, this particular road was notorious for dead crows on account of two very basic reasons, the first, it's proximity to bushland which ensured a considerable amount of regular road kill (possums, kangaroos, etcetera) and second, the road was a significant trucking route.
It follows logic, although I did not see it at the time, that it was determined that the trucks, rather than the cars which used the road were to blame regarding the amount of dead crows. How so, you ask? I, too, was interested to know. 
You see, the front of the average car in these modern times is made of plastic and paint whereas the Australian cross-country truck is equipped with a large alloy bullbar. A crow, when hit by a car will have chips of paint transferred onto its feathers whereas one downed by a truck will have none. 
Now crows are not usually struck by vehicles, as they are a very intelligent bird. As such, they employ a sentry bird, which looks out as the others eat from the road, and warns them of any approaching danger. Such is the intelligence of the crows!
So why should they perish by truck in such numbers? The answer amazed me.

Looks will eat anything,"A bloke starts his new job at the zoo and is given three tasks.

The first is to clear the exotic fish pool of weeds. He starts on this when suddenly a huge fish leaps out and bites him. He is not going to let a fish have a go so he beats the offending fish to death with a spade.

Realising that his boss is not going to be best pleased, he tries to find a way to hide the dead fish. He hits on the brilliant idea of giving the fish to the lions as lions will eat anything. So he throws the fish into the lion's cage.

He then moves on to his second job, which is to clear out the monkey house. He goes in and a couple of chimps starts throwing coconuts at him. Not amused he swipes at the chimps with his spade, killing them instantly. He's really worried now, so what does he do? He feeds the chimps to the lions, because lions eat anything. He hurls them into the lion's cage.

Anyway, he moves on to his last job, which is to collect honey from South American bees. He starts on this and quickly gets attacked by the bees.Alarmed, he grabs his spade and smashes the bees as hard as he can, squashing them to death. By this point he is not too worried about the death of bees as he knows what to do by now. He throws them into the lion's cage, because lions eat anything.

A man and woman are getting divorced...,"They're dividing their assets with the assistance of a judge. Most things are fairly straightforward: each keeps the car they primarily drove, all of their bank accounts were held jointly so that money gets split evenly, and they didn't have any kids, so there's no custody battle. A few household goods were wanted by both sides, so the judge stepped in and worked to evenly divide everything.

Finally, the couple is pretty satisfied with the outcome, and they give each other a nervous look as the man says ""The only thing left is the house.

"I'm just lying there, in bed, in the early morning light, and with blurred vision I see a small white styrofoam cup with a plastic lid. It sat on the table's corner right in front of my face. I hear Father in a firm but quiet voice address me directly. ""In this cup is evidence of a crime.""","Still very tired after a long night, I squint for a look, and all I can see is a little white liquid residue clinging to the edges in the cup. And a wave of guilt floods me awake.

""What does he mean, crime?,"" I think. My dad always seems serious, not the joking type. He has a lot of authority after all. I must be in a lot of trouble. And he's just waiting for me like he wants me to figure it out. And then it hits me. I remembered the name of it.

It began one evening around dinner time. A man walks up to the window and orders some brisket and some sides for his family. Waiting as though in a trance. He sees a little family huddled together nearby just waiting, children surrounding their parent, as it were. A large man with a disheveled look walks straight up to them all, and grabs the largest of them with one hand. ""What's going on,"" the man thinks, leaning in for a better view but it's hard to see. ""What's he holding? Is he tearing his clothes off?""

It appeared to be a cabbie in fact. Or it did at first. Like the one he just hailed moments before. In minutes that cabbie was left in a motionless heap.

The man grabbed his next victim. That little boy in a second was manhandled and pinned down by his wispy little head of green hair. And in another minute that little boy's head goes flying tossed off to the side.

And immediately a next victim. Round in the middle just like dad. They called him Robby for short. Worked over like his dad and as the first boy. His body just shredded and heaped up with the others.

And then a young sweet fragile little girl was last. It seems she had it worst somehow. Thrown over and over against this stiff metal grate, but carefully as though counting each blow. She was mostly left quite in tact. ""Is he saving her for later?"" The man thought.

On one side of the terrible man lay most of their bodies in a pile, but on the other, the girl almost like she was untouched but a little smaller. The violent man quickly grabbed what remained of the boys' and cabbie's head, rolled them up in the cabbie's stripped outer layers with his medallion, to dispose of them discretely. And then immediately stashed the girl away out of sight.

And then, surprisingly, it was not over yet. The man turned back to the pile again rather than making his escape. It was really an indiscriminate pile of pieces dripping in their own blood, as it were, but the man was not finished yet. Is he pouring something on them? And just then a somewhat sickly, sour and salty smell wafted through to where the man waited and watched.

In short, they discovered the cab badge, inevitably leading them to that shredded wet pile. The heads. So much of it wantonly marinated only for profit or personal enjoyment. So, now, we have Kohl's law.

Here's [an article with some of essential early and gory details](https://www.thespruceeats.com/carrot-kohlrabi-slaw-2217352). It came out of France of course.

A large man with a disheveled look walks straight up to them all, and grabs the largest of them with one hand. ""What's going on,"" the man thinks, leaning in for a better view but it's hard to see. ""What's he holding? Is he tearing his clothes off?""

It appeared to be a cabbie in fact. Or it did at first. Like the one he just hailed moments before. In minutes that cabbie was left in a motionless heap.

The man grabbed his next victim. That little boy in a second was manhandled and pinned down by his wispy little head of green hair. And in another minute that little boy's head goes flying tossed off to the side.

And immediately a next victim. Round in the middle just like dad. They called him Robby for short. Worked over like his dad and as the first boy. His body just shredded and heaped up with the others.

And then a young sweet fragile little girl was last. It seems she had it worst somehow. Thrown over and over against this stiff metal grate, but carefully as though counting each blow. She was mostly left quite in tact. ""Is he saving her for later?"" The man thought.

On one side of the terrible man lay most of their bodies in a pile, but on the other, the girl almost like she was untouched but a little smaller. The violent man quickly grabbed what remained of the boys' and cabbie's head, rolled them up in the cabbie's stripped outer layers with his medallion, to dispose of them discretely. And then immediately stashed the girl away out of sight.

And then, surprisingly, it was not over yet. The man turned back to the pile again rather than making his escape. It was really an indiscriminate pile of pieces dripping in their own blood, as it were, but the man was not finished yet. Is he pouring something on them? And just then a somewhat sickly, sour and salty smell wafted through to where the man waited and watched.

In short, they discovered the cab badge, inevitably leading them to that shredded wet pile. The heads. So much of it wantonly marinated only for profit or personal enjoyment. So, now, we have Kohl's law.

Here's [an article with some of essential early and gory details](https://www.thespruceeats.com/carrot-kohlrabi-slaw-2217352). It came out of France of course. Remember that violent man, a real *traiteur* as they say, if you visit. Beware, the article has images."

"Dad joke from two fathers, Click and Clack","Outside a small Macedonian village, close to the border between Greece and strife torn Yugoslavia, a lone Catholic nun keeps a quiet watch over a silent convent. She is the last caretaker of a site of significant historic developments. The convent once served as a base for the army of Attila the Hun. In more ancient times, a Greek temple to Eros, the god of love, occupied the hilltop site.

The Huns are believed to have first collected and then destroyed a large gathering of Greek legal writs at the site. It is believed that Attila wanted to study the Greek legal system and had the writs and other documents brought to the temple.

When the Greek church took over the site in the 15th Century and the convent was built, church leaders ordered the pagan statue of Eros destroyed, so another ancient Greek treasure was lost. Today, there is only the lone sister, watching over the old Hun base.

A man was driving down the road when his car breaks down near a monastery.,"He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, and even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before.

The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night; he tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.‚Äù The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""

The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks."" In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""

Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive; his life's wish is behind that door!
