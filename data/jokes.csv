854,"I went for a long drive on the weekend, and there was something that troubled me.","I'm Australian, in Australia, specifically southern Australia. Very specifically, southern Victoria. Anyway.
I took a long drive on Friday, iut to Halls Gap, which is a beautiful part of the world. Oddly, I noticed along the way a significant amount of dead crows on the side of the road.
Now I'm of courty stock, and I know well that crows (although technically ravens I believe) are am extraordinarily intelligent bird, and it's very rare that you see one fallen bu the roadside. As such, it was obvious to me as unusual.
So I looked it up, and as it happened there'd been a study conducted regarding the very road I'd driven down. Turns out, this particular road was notorious for dead crows on account of two very basic reasons, the first, it's proximity to bushland which ensured a considerable amount of regular road kill (possums, kangaroos, etcetera) and second, the road was a significant trucking route.
It follows logic, although I did not see it at the time, that it was determined that the trucks, rather than the cars which used the road were to blame regarding the amount of dead crows. How so, you ask? I, too, was interested to know. 
You see, the front of the average car in these modern times is made of plastic and paint whereas the Australian cross-country truck is equipped with a large alloy bullbar. A crow, when hit by a car will have chips of paint transferred onto its feathers whereas one downed by a truck will have none. 
Now crows are not usually struck by vehicles, as they are a very intelligent bird. As such, they employ a sentry bird, which looks out as the others eat from the road, and warns them of any approaching danger. Such is the intelligence of the crows!
So why should they perish by truck in such numbers? The answer amazed me.

I'm Australian, in Australia, specifically southern Australia. Very specifically, southern Victoria. Anyway.
I took a long drive on Friday, iut to Halls Gap, which is a beautiful part of the world. Oddly, I noticed along the way a significant amount of dead crows on the side of the road.
Now I'm of courty stock, and I know well that crows (although technically ravens I believe) are am extraordinarily intelligent bird, and it's very rare that you see one fallen bu the roadside. As such, it was obvious to me as unusual.
So I looked it up, and as it happened there'd been a study conducted regarding the very road I'd driven down.

The first is to clear the exotic fish pool of weeds. He starts on this when suddenly a huge fish leaps out and bites him. He is not going to let a fish have a go so he beats the offending fish to death with a spade.

Realising that his boss is not going to be best pleased, he tries to find a way to hide the dead fish. He hits on the brilliant idea of giving the fish to the lions as lions will eat anything. So he throws the fish into the lion's cage.

He then moves on to his second job, which is to clear out the monkey house. He goes in and a couple of chimps starts throwing coconuts at him. Not amused he swipes at the chimps with his spade, killing them instantly. He's really worried now, so what does he do? He feeds the chimps to the lions, because lions eat anything. He hurls them into the lion's cage.

Anyway, he moves on to his last job, which is to collect honey from South American bees. He starts on this and quickly gets attacked by the bees.Alarmed, he grabs his spade and smashes the bees as hard as he can, squashing them to death. By this point he is not too worried about the death of bees as he knows what to do by now. He throws them into the lion's cage, because lions eat anything.

[Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_%26_Palmer) are celebrating the release of [their album Tarkus](https://vinyl-records.nl/prog-rock/elp/emerson-lake-palmer-tarkus-island-records-gatefold-album-cover-vinyl-lp-album.html) at the [Seven Stars Pub](https://londonspubswherehistoryreallyhappened.wordpress.com/2017/07/07/the-seven-stars/).

""What does he mean, crime?,"" I think. My dad always seems serious, not the joking type. He has a lot of authority after all. I must be in a lot of trouble. And he's just waiting for me like he wants me to figure it out. And then it hits me. I remembered the name of it.

FAIR WARNING! All kinds of triggers here. DO NOT READ.

It began one evening around dinner time. A man walks up to the window and orders some brisket and some sides for his family. Waiting as though in a trance. He sees a little family huddled together nearby just waiting, children surrounding their parent, as it were. A large man with a disheveled look walks straight up to them all, and grabs the largest of them with one hand. ""What's going on,"" the man thinks, leaning in for a better view but it's hard to see. ""What's he holding? Is he tearing his clothes off?""

It appeared to be a cabbie in fact. Or it did at first. Like the one he just hailed moments before. In minutes that cabbie was left in a motionless heap.

The man grabbed his next victim. That little boy in a second was manhandled and pinned down by his wispy little head of green hair. And in another minute that little boy's head goes flying tossed off to the side.

And immediately a next victim. Round in the middle just like dad. They called him Robby for short. Worked over like his dad and as the first boy. His body just shredded and heaped up with the others.

And then a young sweet fragile little girl was last. It seems she had it worst somehow. Thrown over and over against this stiff metal grate, but carefully as though counting each blow. She was mostly left quite in tact. ""Is he saving her for later?"" The man thought.

On one side of the terrible man lay most of their bodies in a pile, but on the other, the girl almost like she was untouched but a little smaller. The violent man quickly grabbed what remained of the boys' and cabbie's head, rolled them up in the cabbie's stripped outer layers with his medallion, to dispose of them discretely. And then immediately stashed the girl away out of sight.

And then, surprisingly, it was not over yet. The man turned back to the pile again rather than making his escape. It was really an indiscriminate pile of pieces dripping in their own blood, as it were, but the man was not finished yet. Is he pouring something on them? And just then a somewhat sickly, sour and salty smell wafted through to where the man waited and watched.

In short, they discovered the cab badge, inevitably leading them to that shredded wet pile. The heads. So much of it wantonly marinated only for profit or personal enjoyment. So, now, we have Kohl's law.

[nsfw],"As they're on stage, upbeat music begins to play, and they all strip down until they are completely naked. The boy approaches the father and begins to jerk him off until he is fully erect, leading to the father penetrating his daughter's asshole, who screams and starts shitting on his dick in response. The mother bends over and starts licking the shitty dick and balls, and starts to piss, and as her son sees this he goes under the yellow, steamy stream and begins to gobble it up. The father then performs a whistle, and their dog approaches to him running, barely managing to not to slip all over the piss, shit, sweat, and cum, and when he makes it to him, the father fingers his asshole causing the dog to let out a loud bark, and the family all stand in a line, hold each other's hands, and take a bow.

The talent agent is flabbergasted, taking a moment to gather himself, and then says: ""Wow, that's quite the show. What do you guys call yourselves?""

Hitman: Yes, that's me.

Man: Ok, cool.

*Both men take a sip of their glass of whiskey.""

Man: You know... there is no reason for me to be afraid of you. I have a lot of enemies, but fortunately for me, they are all broke. None of them would ever be able to afford $10,000. Unless they would borrow the money somewhere. But even then, I am still not afraid of you. I have a dozen of homies who have my back at any time. They would destroy you before you could even get to me.

Hitman: Hahahaha, you're a funny kid.

Man: I am not joking. You know what is a joke? You, and your whole $10,000 price tag. Why the hell do you charge $10,000 for your bullet?

Hitman: Well, if my bullet would hit you, you would know why it is so expensive. And if you survive, you can also go and tell your dozen homies why my bullet is so expensive. They can get a piece of the pie too, if they want some.

Man: Well, if I survive getting hit by your expensive bullet, it sure is not worth that $10,000 price tag.

Hitman: Dude, how many times are you going to mention that $10,000? Get off my case already. The $10,000 isn't even for the bullet, so **STOP** asking me why my darned bullet is so expensive!!!

Man: Wait wait wait wait, hold on a second. Why do you charge $10,000 then, if your bullet doesn't even cost $10,000?

Hitman: Kid, I swear to God..... if you say $10,000 one more time......

*The hitman takes a huge swig of his glass of whiskey before continuing his sentence.*

Hitman: Look, you're a bit simple for thinking a bullet could ever cost that much in the first place. The bullet I use only costs $1, but if I fail to kill you, I call a hitman friend of mine to do the job. He can aim a lot better than me but he charges $9,999 for the kill.""

Man: Wow, why does that dude charge you so much for just a single kill?

Hitman: Well, he lives on the other side of the world so he needs the money so that he can buy a round-trip plane ticket, and also pay other transport fees such as riding a couple of taxies and such. And of course there's also food costs, hotel costs etc.

Man: I see. Well, it is quite obvious to me that you are total and complete fool for several reasons. The first reason: you are telling me all of this. The second reason: I will be gone to a place far far away from here by the time your hitman friend arrives here. The third reason: why did you even become a hitman if you can't even shoot a gun properly? And the fourth reason: contrary to what I initially thought, you are not getting rich from this. You'll be living in a van down by the river soon if you don't get your life together fast, bud.

*The hitman starts crying. The bartender rushes over with a box of tissues. The hitman dries his tears and blows his nose a few times.*

Hitman: You are absolutely right man. I am nothing but a joke. And not even a funny one either. I am an anti-joke.

Man: Look man, we all make mistakes. It's okay. Nobody is perfect. As long as you learn from your mistakes and use your newfound knowledge to make your life better, everything will be just fine. For starters, I'd suggest getting a normal job. One that you actually do have the qualifications for. The local McDonalds is looking for someone to flip burgers, maybe that is something better suited for you?

Hitman: Thank you very much for your advice man. I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I think I could manage flipping burgers. I will call them tomorrow and apply for the vacancy. Thanks again dude, I owe you one!

Man: Well, I'll take you up on that offer right now. I'll have another glass of whiskey.

140,The Most Nefarious and Ill-Minded Outlaw Walks Into a Modest Western Saloon in His Small and Frail Old Western Town with Bad Intentions and Zero Empathy‚Ä¶,"
He stands 6‚Äô10 and is extremely brutal. Upon arrival he shoots the sky a few times and spits into the dirt before smiling to the bartenders wife (in a way to mess with the bartender and impose his power). Too bad she‚Äôs blind, the bartender thinks. ‚ÄòHaha sucker, what a tool‚Äô, he says quietly to himself as he washes some dishes. 

The normal jingle toons are playing on the saloon piano, tonight performed by Robin Smith, the only musician in the western town. The outlaw doesn‚Äôt like this perceived power this gives the pianist and decides to confront him. Give me your hands he demands, with a tone so mean that it made the outlaw low key a little scared of himself. The pianist goes okay man, here you go. Right as they were about to make hand contact, the saloon pianist, slapped the outlaw and said, hey fuck you douche, you can eat my shit how about that?‚Äù He then poops on the floor to maintain his ground and defend his pride. 

The outlaw growls. And tremors. And convulses. And relapses on old western cocaine. He‚Äôs now a complete Diesel engine, enough power to drill through a mountain of gold. He rips off his outerwear to reveal his inner wear. Contrasting with his casual outerwear, which consisted of typical old western cowboy attire, his inside wear was modeled in a way that could be described as, according to town comedian, Al Snelly: ‚Äúhe looks like the devil if they were a little sissy prick bitch fuck face.‚Äù

The saloon dies in laughter. They can‚Äôt believe how funny the comedian is. They decide to agree on building him a statue in the town center. 

The outlaw roars and looks around. He senses that they don‚Äôt fear him. ‚ÄúARRRRR ROAR HOHOHOGWHXBNDJE‚Äù *eyes rolling back, shaking head aggressively* 

‚ÄúOk you idiots, you want a mean outlaw. Well, take a look at this.‚Äù
He reveals a necklace he had been wearing, with something attached to it that was quite surprising to witnesses. The saloon dog even had to wipe his glasses off to make sure he was seeing it right. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ruff‚Äù, he barks to himself. Oh Tito.

‚ÄúHow you like me now?!‚Äù He screams at the crowd. ‚ÄúWe hate you loser-douche-bitch!‚Äù This time it was the town priest to yell at the outlaw. ‚ÄúYou could die and not even I would care.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn face I could kill everyone and not even care.‚Äù
The town sheriff takes him to prison and gives him beatings.

The necklace is still the center of attention. The crowd looks at each other. Mumbles erupt questioning if they are all seeing the same thing.

A man in the back anonymously shouts out, ‚Äúis he wearing a necklace of dicks, wtf that sus fo-fo? Dude I would so deadass  beat you up, no cap!‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry I have no idea what that means man, what‚Äôs sus?‚Äù Crowd wonders what tf that means as well. 1800s English tended to be less stupid.

So, the anonymous man, a time traveler , leaves quietly as he has blown his cover. 

‚ÄúWhat he meant is why do you have a cock chain, you dick nugget? It smells like shit, loser, get out of here and go beat urself up emotionally.‚Äù 
CROWD CHEERS AND CLAPS

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just dick man, I also made a crown of toes, look.‚Äù 

*shows his crown of moldy toes*

The town psychologist walks in and immediately says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a psychologist and I think this mans nuts!‚Äù 

The outlaw now realizes he needed bigger more scary cock on his necklace to fend off townsfolk/inferiors. North and moose would be the move next time. A job did open in the great north, according to travelers riding through town, as a moose hospice manager. 

He then faints. Wait no, old man Johnson knocked him out. He‚Äôs not patient and he wanted to listen to the tunes.

This happens every Monday, as the outlaw is actually the town financial advisor‚Äôs son who lost his brains ability to form sense of situations and realities. Every Mondays knockouts don‚Äôt help his mental shortcomings. He literally goes on in life, total improv without realizing he is improv‚Äôing. Scary I know, but it‚Äôs not as bad as what happens next. Right as the town was going to calm the town idiot down, or known by everyone as Tommy Keithy, he was shot by his horse, Grotto shot him in the knee and then bit off his cock and then pooped on his face till he couldn‚Äôt breathe. The town was in shock. Like it was tons of poop and a normal sized horse?

Investigations determined that Grotto was a member of a horse gang, known as, ‚ÄúRedRum Goontisberg‚Äù (Horse for the Slick Killers)

Grotto is given electric horse chair and thrown into the dumpster behind the saloon which will know be known as, ‚ÄúBad-Boy Tommy‚Äôs‚Äù

(The dick on his necklace appeared to be from dead horses, as Tommy worked at a horse hospice, so he had access to their parts to create his outlaw necklace)

***It is a bright and sunny morning in Delaware, where one trendy couple is working on their next big hit***

Axel gets his hair ready for tik tok. He sprays it, do some combs here and there, makes some mean faces to himself in the mirror. He's ready. It's showtime baby. He grabs his mugshot and heads to the filming room.

\*Ashley gets the song ""Criminal"" by Brittney Speirs"" ready to play for the 'tok vid\*

Videos made. Took little effort, but brought immense pride. Ashley is shaking. She's gonna be a hit.

""I love you baby, thanks."" she huge Axel

""Woah, back off **tf** bitch, who you think I am? I *ain't* no snuggler""

**\*RELATIONSHIP GOALS!\***

\-She tells herself this constantly to reaffirm to herself that she is indeed not in a dead-end, toxic, unhealthy relationship that sparked off an odd tik tok trend. Her father is this close to killing Axel. Last week he had to hold himself back from taking the chainsaw to his forehead for how he spoke to his daughter, Ansley. He knows how young criminal celebrities are -- He was one in his era.

Ashley's stepfather was somewhat of a criminal during his youth. Killing 4 before he was 12 and smoking meth like it was oxygen, her father had a rough childhood. However, one day he grabbed his nuts with a wrench and tortured himself till he became a good person. He still has the trophies from the murders in his basement but refuses to look at them. He was every girl's dream. They dropped their panties on sight, as his awful crimes were a turn on. (His bowl-cut certainly wasn't).

Next week Axel decided to admit to his girlfriend he never was locked up. The court felt bad because he was constantly getting jumped in prison and was also subject to a prison record, 400 men (while he was tied down) went up bent over his nose, and released their gas. Axel lost 45 IQ off the fart sniffing tragedy as it was burrito night, and shit was really running through the inmates.

She took it well and said maybe they weren't a good match. A few days pass, and axel sees that she posted a new, but rather similar, 'tok.

\*Oh my fuck\* , he mumbles to himself.

It's of her and her stepdad. Dumb hoe he thinks while picking his nose.

""Now that's criminal.."" He laughs emphatically at his joke, even though deep down Axel knows how lonely/hopeless he is and is aware that no one loves him.

He tries again to boost himself up with another quick self-joke: ""I'm named Axel, but can't fix anything..."" He somberly laughs, before farting and going outside to light a cig and work on his bike.

311,So a guy walks into a bar one day,"and he can‚Äôt believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there‚Äôs this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.

So the guy asks the bartender, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd he come from?‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a genie in the men‚Äôs room who grants wishes.‚Äù

So the guy runs into the men‚Äôs room and, sure enough, there‚Äôs this genie. And the genie‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúYour wish is my command.‚Äù So the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúO.K., I wish for world peace.‚Äù And there‚Äôs this big cloud of smoke‚Äîand then the room fills up with geese.

So the guy walks out of the men‚Äôs room and he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúHey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?‚Äù

So the guy processes this. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúDoes that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúYeah. Why, what did you wish for?‚Äù

And the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWorld peace.‚Äù

So the bartender is understandably ashamed.

And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it‚Äôs obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúI feel like I should explain myself further.‚Äù

And the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúI have what‚Äôs known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm small down there. I‚Äôm actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.‚Äù

And the guy feels sorry for him. So he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWhere do you think that comes from?‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn‚Äôt tell her. I think it‚Äôs wrapped up in that somehow.‚Äù

And the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúHave you ever seen anyone about this?‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface.‚Äù

So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúListen, I couldn‚Äôt help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn‚Äôt speak the last ten years of his life.‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúTell me more about that.‚Äù And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.

And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, ‚ÄúHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs horrible.‚Äù

And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúYou know what? I‚Äôm over it. He always said I wouldn‚Äôt amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I‚Äôm a professional musician!‚Äù

And the pianist starts to laugh, but it‚Äôs a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .‚Äù

And then he starts to cry. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúI just wish I‚Äôd had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.‚Äù

And all of a sudden there‚Äôs this big cloud of smoke‚Äîand a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!

And the pianist is, like, ‚ÄúI said ‚Äòold man,‚Äô not ‚Äòold van‚Äô!‚Äù

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, ‚ÄúYour genie‚Äôs hard of hearing.‚Äù

And the bartender says, ‚ÄúNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?‚Äù

And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, ‚ÄúOh, my God. You didn‚Äôt really want me.‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not like that.‚Äù You know, trying to backpedal.

And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, ‚ÄúOnce an accident, always an accident.‚Äù And he drinks all of his whiskey.

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúBrian, I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean that.‚Äù

And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, ‚ÄúWell, I didn‚Äôt mean that.‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWhoa, calm down.‚Äù

And the pianist is, like, ‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù And he‚Äôs really drunk, because he‚Äôs only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!‚Äù

And he starts throwing punches, but he‚Äôs too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender‚Äôs arms.

And suddenly he has this revelation. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúMy God, I‚Äôm just like him. I‚Äôm just like him.‚Äù And he starts weeping.

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre better than he was.‚Äù

And the pianist is, like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôm worthless!‚Äù

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, ‚ÄúDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You‚Äôre so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.‚Äù

And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.

So the guy, who‚Äôs been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn‚Äôt know the bartender was gay. It doesn‚Äôt bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there‚Äôs the genie.

So the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.‚Äù

And the genie‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWho says they‚Äôre broken?‚Äù And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.

And the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWell done.‚Äù

And then the genie says, ‚ÄúThat bartender‚Äôs tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.‚Äù

And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.

And the genie‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I should‚Äôve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.‚Äù

And the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. Let‚Äôs just grab a beer. It‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

TL,BICSRI (Too Long, But I Can Still Read It); 
‚Ä¶
The year is 1978. A down on his luck monk walks out of a bar.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of all these one-line joke set ups!‚Äù The monk shouts to a group of dwarves escorting a chicken across the road. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had it up to here with all this shit,‚Äù he continues, although to be fair, without actually seeing how high he held his hand (alliteration, am I right?) it‚Äôs kinda difficult just to describe exactly up to *where* he‚Äôs had it with, quote, ‚Äúall this shit.‚Äù [1] But suffice to say, if he feels the need to shout it out in a poultry-and-height-challenged community (how remarkably progressive of society,) then it‚Äôs fair to assume he was pissed as fuck.

Anyway, so the monk is just strolling around, when he's approached by someone who becomes a future anti-hero and then later the co-protagonist, but is simply referred to as 'the stranger‚Äô at this point.

‚ÄúAhhhhhhh,‚Äù the stranger murmurs, with a tone that conveys precisely seven h's. After going back to count the h‚Äôs, our reader returns to the story, smiling a little to themselves, subconsciously hoping the OP has a new YouTube channel they could subscribe to. Ahem, DM me, ahem.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù The monk asks rhetorically, suddenly hoping the stranger doesn't need help because his words were hollow and he‚Äôs just, in general, a bit of a dick.

‚ÄúHelp me, you cannot. But help you I can try to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's an awful Yoda impression,‚Äù the monk replies, ‚ÄúSeriously man, [or, insert desired gender here], like, Yoda is literally famous for saying, *there is no try*,‚Äù continues the monk, with a very good point.

‚ÄúA try in rugby, there is though,‚Äù the stranger replies, also having a fair point. So like, if this was a formal debate, it would be tough to call a winner. ‚ÄúBeside the point though that is, to tell you your past and predict your future, I have come.‚Äù

‚ÄúCum,‚Äù sniggers Horny Dwarf as he eavesdrops.

‚ÄúA troubled child you were,‚Äù whispers the stranger slowly to the monk, as our reader imagines soft violin music playing melodically in the background. ‚ÄúNay, a *curious* child. And no ordinary child were you. But nevertheless, despite your remarkable ape-like defects, care for you very well did the man in the yellow hat.

TL,BICSRI (Too Long, But I Can Still Read It); 
‚Ä¶
The year is 1978. A down on his luck monk walks out of a bar.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of all these one-line joke set ups!‚Äù The monk shouts to a group of dwarves escorting a chicken across the road. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had it up to here with all this shit,‚Äù he continues, although to be fair, without actually seeing how high he held his hand (alliteration, am I right?) it‚Äôs kinda difficult just to describe exactly up to *where* he‚Äôs had it with, quote, ‚Äúall this shit.‚Äù [1] But suffice to say, if he feels the need to shout it out in a poultry-and-height-challenged community (how remarkably progressive of society,) then it‚Äôs fair to assume he was pissed as fuck.

Anyway, so the monk is just strolling around, when he's approached by someone who becomes a future anti-hero and then later the co-protagonist, but is simply referred to as 'the stranger‚Äô at this point.

‚ÄúAhhhhhhh,‚Äù the stranger murmurs, with a tone that conveys precisely seven h's. After going back to count the h‚Äôs, our reader returns to the story, smiling a little to themselves, subconsciously hoping the OP has a new YouTube channel they could subscribe to. Ahem, DM me, ahem.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù The monk asks rhetorically, suddenly hoping the stranger doesn't need help because his words were hollow and he‚Äôs just, in general, a bit of a dick.

‚ÄúHelp me, you cannot. But help you I can try to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's an awful Yoda impression,‚Äù the monk replies, ‚ÄúSeriously man, [or, insert desired gender here], like, Yoda is literally famous for saying, *there is no try*,‚Äù continues the monk, with a very good point.

‚ÄúA try in rugby, there is though,‚Äù the stranger replies, also having a fair point. So like, if this was a formal debate, it would be tough to call a winner. ‚ÄúBeside the point though that is, to tell you your past and predict your future, I have come.‚Äù

‚ÄúCum,‚Äù sniggers Horny Dwarf as he eavesdrops.

‚ÄúA troubled child you were,‚Äù whispers the stranger slowly to the monk, as our reader imagines soft violin music playing melodically in the background. ‚ÄúNay, a *curious* child. And no ordinary child were you. But nevertheless, despite your remarkable ape-like defects, care for you very well did the man in the yellow hat. Difficult times were during highschool, so off adventuring to seek your true calling did you go‚Ä¶‚Äù

 At this point, to speed things up, you may swallow the knot, and let your digestive tract naturally begin to pull the rest of the rope and body wash applicators through your  system.  

At the 30 foot mark, you should have plenty of time to rub some ground Himalayan salt  along a 5 foot length of the rope.  This will initially dry your intestines and then draw water through the intestinal walls, which will help to further clean your tract.

At the 40 foot mark, rub baking soda in the rope, for the next ten feet.  This will very naturally deodorize your intestines, and make them feel vibrant and limber.

At the 60 foot mark, tie 25\* more body wash applicator to the rope in 1 foot increments.

At this point the first set of body wash applicators should be on their way out, don't forget to check them for crayons you may have eaten as a child.  

Finally, at the end of the rope, tie a large grout sponge to the very end and wait.  Patience is a must!  You may be sorely tempted to pull on the exited rope to speed up the process, RESIST THIS URGE!!!  Let your body pull the rope through your system naturally.

After this process, your butt should remain clean for nearly one week.

But if you‚Äôve ever made a big batch of them, you know the mechanics behind these goodies are a big pain in the neck. Finding a big pot, waiting for the water to boil, putting in the eggs carefully enough to avoid cracking, and waiting again for them to cook is just one step too many, in our opinion.

Thankfully, there‚Äôs an easier way to hard-boil eggs by the dozen. But don‚Äôt turn to the stovetop; use your oven, instead. (Are you a hard-boiled hater?.)

8:58am. The old woman closes the pink door to her room and walks down the long pink hallway. She passes 1 pink door on her way to the pink staircase. She walks down 3 flights of pink stairs and down another pink hallway past various pink paintings, pink tables set atop plush pink carpeting and covered with pink flowers and pink knickknacks. She stops to admire a pink birdcage on a pink stand. In it is 4 pink singbirds chirping in the pink glow of the morning sun streaming through the pink lace curtains. The smell of bacon fills her pink nose and her stomach grumbles with anticipation. She heads into a beautiful pink dining room complete with pink place settings, pink table cloth and even a pink crystal chandelier. The pink innkeeper greets her with a smile from behind her pink lipstick laden lips as she pours her a pink glass full of pink champagne. ""Good pink morning!"" she said. ""In addition the the pink buffet to your left, we have your choice of pink corn flakes or pink frosted flakes. Which would you prefer?"" The old woman chooses the pink frosted flakes. The pink innkeeper goes into the pink kitchen, picks up a pink bowl and fills it with pink frosted flakes. She then pours the perfect amount of pink milk into the bowl and delivers it to the old woman along with a pink spoon. She makes herself a pink plate full of pink bacon and pink French toast the pink buffet and sits down in her pink chair to enjoy her meal.

9:01am. The old man is late. He is sitting on the edge of his bed staring at the tiny pink envelope he had found the previous day. He was unsure if he should open it. He had almost done it twice already but felt guilty for taking it from the pink crack under the pink doorbell. He notices he is late so he puts the still sealed envelope back into his coat pocket, grabs his cane from the pink coat rack and heads for the pink door. The old man closes the pink door to his room and walks down the long pink hallway. He passes a pink cat licking his pink paws on his way to the pink staircase. He walks down 3 flights of pink stairs and down another pink hallway past various pink paintings, pink tables set atop plush pink carpeting and covered with pink flowers and pink knickknacks. He heads into a beautiful pink dining room complete with pink place settings, pink table cloth and even a pink crystal chandelier. The pink innkeeper greets him with a smile from behind her pink lipstick laden lips as she pours him a pink glass full of pink champagne. ""Good pink morning!"" she said. ""In addition the the pink buffet to your left, we have your choice of pink corn flakes or pink frosted flakes. Which would you prefer?"" The old man chooses the pink frosted flakes. The pink innkeeper goes into the pink kitchen, picks up a pink bowl and fills it with pink frosted flakes. She then pours the perfect amount of pink milk into the bowl and delivers it to the old man along with a pink spoon. He isn't very hungry so he skips the pink buffet and just eats his pink frosted flakes while still contemplating what to do with the envelope. 

The guests all finish their pink meals and make their way back to their pink rooms to pack their belongings. They all walk together out of the pink dining room past the various pink paintings, pink tables set atop plush pink carpeting covered with pink flowers and pink knickknacks. They walk up 3 flights of pink stairs and down the long pink hallway each stopping at their pink doors before entering their pink rooms. After packing they all head back downstairs to check out. Back down the long pink hallway, down 3 flights of pink stairs, down another pink hallway past various pink paintings and pink tables set atop plush pink carpeting covered with pink flowers and pink knickknacks. The pink innkeeper thanks all of them for staying at her pink B&amp;B and hands each of them a small pink gift bag full of pink toiletries and some homemade pink salt water taffy. 

The old man is last to leave. As he walks out onto the pink porch and the pink door closes behind him, he reaches into his pocket one more time and pulls out that tiny pink envelope. He turns it over in his hand wondering what secrets it holds. He thinks back over his long life. Images of loves lost and missed opportunities flood his brain. He pulls a small pocket knife that he has carried since he was a boy. It has an inlaid bone handle and his initials engraved on one side. His father had given it to him before going of to die in the war. The knife opens with a soft click and he slowly peels back the wax seal with the razor sharp blade. Finally, he sees what is in the envelope. 

The moral of this story...


4 out of 5 people prefer frosted flakes over corn flakes."

819,A man's car breaks down outside a farm and he asks the farmer if he can stay the night.

He was, after all, a married man who loved his wife dearly and would never dream of betraying the woman who had supported him through the recent death of his own  mother and had nursed him for three months in 2014 after a car accident left him broken and bedridden. But for a slightly reduced range of motion in his right arm, he carried no noticeable impairment and he was grateful to have retained the ability to carry out virtually all everyday tasks. He often joked that the only thing that was seriously affected was his golf game but he knew that it was a relatively small price to pay for walking away largely unscathed from a potentially fatal collision. His good fortune was not shared by the passenger of the other vehicle who had suffered tramatic neck and shoulder injuries as a result of the crash and now lived with chronic back pain. 

The man lay awake in bed, fingers interlocked behind his head and stared st the barn ceiling. His bed was soft and seemed to receive him welcomingly. He sank gently into the mattress like a strawberry placed atop a bowl of warm custard. Warm and sheltered. The crash of thunder outside could barely be heard through the thick barn walls.

Right then he wanted nothing more than for his wife to be sharing the bed with him. He could see her now and he thought of how much he loved be the first thing she saw in the morning. She would gently open her eyes and squint and squirm before smiling at him. Her thick Mediterranean hair strown over her shoulders and her nipples soft and playful. She would pull him on top of her with a square look that was sexy as hell and slide her slender body beneath his hips. She would then hold the back of his head with one hand and with the other take his wrist and suck his finger before moving it down towards her pussy...

At this moment the man realised that he was completely hard. He reached down and grabbed his dick and with embarrassingly few strokes came all over his clean bedsheets. Damn, he thought, what a shitty guest I turned out to be. He certainly wouldn't like it if some stranger to whom he had given refuge left him with cum stained sheets. But at least he hadn't fucked any of the farmer's daughters which was, in fact, the only condition of his stay expressly outlined by the farmer. If he didn't want me to jack it in the barn, he probably should have made that clear from the start, the man rationalized as he drifted off to sleep, still basking in the afterglow of his climax.

The next morning the man dressed himself and collected his belongings. His roadside assist came to get his car started and he was soon to be on his way.
Before leaving, he turned to thank the farmer who had not yet entered the barn to remove the old bed sheets.

""Thank you, my friend.""
""No. Thank you."" replied the farmer.
""For what? I didn't do anything but stay in your barn.""

The farmer sighed, ""Thank you for not having sex with my daughters but instead choosing to masturbate to thoughts of your wife to satisfy your night time sexual impulses. Marriage is important and it sounds like you and your wife have a very special connection which should be celebrated and revered. Always treat her with respect and be the best man you can be for her and she will always be there to support you no matter what comes your way..."" The farmer was abruptly cut off by the sound of a distressed sheep tangled in fencing wire.
""I best be off, son. Drive safe and take care.""

The man stood dumbfounded and silently got in his car completely shocked by what he had just heard. He started the engine and sat for a moment.

Before leaving, he wound down his window and yelled out to the farmer. ""Hey, how the hell did you know all that? Who are you?""

The farmer looked up from his now freed sheep and responded,""My name is James. Le Bron James.""

However, the real villain appears, grabs her, and throws her into the street, yelling ‚ÄúBitch you ain‚Äôt me who are u?‚Äù He then walks out the front door, spits on her, and leaves without the gang unmasking him. 

Before she can react a group of men help her up and asks if she‚Äôs ok. She says yes thank you. They say ok get in the car and point guns to her head. 9 guns. She complies but one accidentally shoots and luckily misses. Not lucky for little John-Paul, who was just leaving the children‚Äôs hospital across the street.

When she gets taken, Fred looks concerned. He says hmmm that was really bad , guys, but let‚Äôs focus on the real villain. Shaggy tells Scooby after that Fred has horrible breath. Fred heard from Scooby and shaggy stops telling Scooby everything. Friendship in a rut, but overall, fine. 

So who took Geraldine? You guessed it, the cartel. (Her body was found a week later cut in 290 pieces and a video tape was left of her gruesome torturing and murder.) Apparently they had thought she was this man named Sanibel Ancho and the men didn‚Äôt have their contacts and were high as shit on mexi cartel bud, however one of the men sneaks coke bumps, as a true closet coke addict would.

Fred closes the day out by reminding the squad that Geraldine was not innocent herself as he did not see her pay for her drink before she was brought out of the bar forcefully.

Jonesy starts humping Tom as he dies but skeeter demands he shows respect. Jonesy adjusts himself and apologizes. Tom is rushed to the hospital and ends up living, only to watch hear that his family had been butchered to pieces by a mad man. Tom realizes that his life is now so sad. Tom marries Skeeter out of guilt and is verbally abused these days, in which skeeter should be apologizing for."

I guess you could say I‚Äôm a dreamer. Some say I am doer. My psychologist says I‚Äôm mentally ill and he told me yesterday he bet his wife a few bucks, and he‚Äôd lick her mole on her toe that I would probably do something that‚Äôd kill a lot of people and make a whole generation of a family eternally depressed. Take a step in my shoes. It‚Äôs a brutal wasteland of rocky crevices. I was mocked at birth, but saved by my beautiful name now. 

But I know what I am. I know what I like. I like sleepovers, pranks, and all that‚Äôs great about life man. Some men like to go dance with ladies at the club, some like playing Monday night club soccer with friends, some like getting piss drunk. Well me, my best guy friends since middle school, starting with Keith, Richy, Sly Louie, and the winner of the most sleepover wrestle events, Donnie! 

Here before I go farther, no one fucking likes Keith. No one, not even his mom. She had a deal with the cartel thatd he be their possession and rumor had it she was ready to trade him for a half day free massage pass for some spa in El Paso. He‚Äôs like a great kid, I trust him fully, he‚Äôs smaller than me, but I have a bigger butt sort of but that is irrelevant. Keith booty be small, in like small terms, it‚Äôs rather tiny. We need a butt slapping sound generating challenge in ‚Äò02 and Keith barely generated any noise and when he got home apparently his dad noticed his ass marks and asked him if he needed some immediate medical assistance but to not tell him what happened bc he doesn‚Äôt care. Surprise. The dad hates Keith, everyone does. Even Keith hates himself but he doesn‚Äôt understand why. He‚Äôs part of sleepover squad bc he used to originally host the original nights. But now, at 26 Keith the fucking loser he is still is in school at Yale University Law School. We fucking make so much fun of him, what a loser with no future. During this sleepover I‚Äôm planning on breaking his collar bone and tricking him till the last second that I‚Äôm going nuts and need to grab some nuts to eat, lol Jk bro tehaha no sus g?

But yea so we‚Äôre 26 now and all grown up with jobs as retail managers while Keith the fucking nerdy man child wants to be in school penciling his own peen night in night out. But yea Richy, Louie, Donnie, I (Philly), all work together at a gift shop in outer Dallas. It‚Äôs nice we make modest money but just sucks they could have had a fourth room for me. I mean I get it, those three are actually brothers, quintuplets to be exact. When they were three there was like some little accident where the three brothers accidentally pushed their other brothers into a woodchipper legs first. Not really important to context, but one of the 2 that died literally got stuck and they all took turns dancing around him to distract him from passing out. The three boys used to be of Satan, but I think I was there missing link. My foundational sleepover program regime ensures good boy behavior.

So back to me, I‚Äôm Philly. I‚Äôm 8‚Äô6 bc I have a rare condition called gigantism, but suffer sadly from the rare micro penis condition. I used to beat myself up, but it wasn‚Äôt good for me to hurt myself. I realized there was more to being tall.  I could be dominating sleepovers! Born with the name Don Hunkus, I was so embarrassed and shocked by that name they gave me that the doctors telepathically understood my request as a newborn infant to immediately change it to Philly, my favorite city I didn‚Äôt know of. As a result of such bad naming and the resulting humiliation it caused my father and mother to move to Spain and find a new kid they said fuckboy we don‚Äôt want u wtf is a Philly fuck u bitch. So I went door to door, I was a newborn infant I didn‚Äôt even know my cardinal directions yet, let alone how to properly approach and sell myself to prospective buyers. The year was 95 man, that was back when cellphones were not a thing like today, I remember as a baby I relied on instincts to find my real mom, Olgalina Wilma Permafert IV. She took me in nursed me with her naturally milk she had saved just in case. I remember her saying she saw my interviews as a newborn on tv with the doctor. Everyone was crying bc they were so proud I avoided the name Don Hunkus. That name wouldn‚Äôt have landed me the sleepover gigs Philly has over the years. But yes meeting Olgalina, we were set in a sleepover headquarters partnership for the next 26 years and counting. She made it super cool and like painted the wall in the third closet a cool beige. I remember that was when I was 18, sleepover age still young.


See wait let‚Äôs clear something up . Sleepovers used to get us bullied at school. We used to even try and show the photos we took of us and our wrestle fights in bed and they just would laugh. Dude I even showed girls my farting on my moms toothbrush and pooping on her face when she was asleep drunk and they laughed and looked away. But yea names they used to call us such bad names. They‚Äôd go Philly, where are the sleepover boys? Wrestling each other without parental supervision and without clean equipment? I would get so nervous I would go no, butch, hank, guys please can we just let that go. That‚Äôs when we had Butch over to see if we could convert him into a sleepover dood, even at the age of 22. The whole time he kept trying to corner Louie in the wrestle matches-&gt; a major red flag

Louie doesn‚Äôt like to talk about it but once he filmed himself for a school project live to Instagram and accidentally slipped and fell and got his ass stuck on a broken tree knob. His ass recovered but never shrunk back down, so I thought I maybe could see Butch trying to sodomize my friend. And sodomy isn‚Äôt part of sleepovers. Na bro. Not cool. So I grabbed Butch and said na bro get out of here and pushed him until this bad timing shit happened. During the fight Louie accidentally started so he was bending over taking of his undies as I pushed Butch and I guess his baggy style of clothes and penchant for viagra was perfect for this situation. He landed in and Louie went full ptsd. He immediately started going psycho man, tightened his grip instead of resisting and ripped off the cock of Butch. Butch was like owww no bro not my
Cum dumper.
Then he like repeated it bc he was mad we didn‚Äôt laugh, and we didn‚Äôt laugh still. Too keep it simply, Butch is barely better than Keith. Keith would not rape Louie like a Butch psycho would, but he would instead cause us constant sadness and depression for eternity. Keith = bad vibes. I wanna fight him till he bleeds out of his ankles. 

Ok so yea I‚Äôm working on clothing designs because I actually did an internship with a clothing design company because I wanted to work on clothing designs and to make clothing designs, the designs are all about what not you did, but the design and its eternal reach, ya feel man.

I actually remmeber at his 16 th birthday it was really funny when we caught his dad kissing the dog naked. He was thrown in jail and Keith was thrown into a downward spiral.

Then he like repeated it bc he was mad we didn‚Äôt laugh, and we didn‚Äôt laugh still. Too keep it simply, Butch is barely better than Keith. Keith would not rape Louie like a Butch psycho would, but he would instead cause us constant sadness and depression for eternity. Keith = bad vibes. I wanna fight him till he bleeds out of his ankles. 

Ok so yea I‚Äôm working on clothing designs because I actually did an internship with a clothing design company because I wanted to work on clothing designs and to make clothing designs, the designs are all about what not you did, but the design and its eternal reach, ya feel man. Yea man I‚Äôm actually pretty well read on phiooosophy when I‚Äôm not organizing the movie room or washing the wrestling sleepover gear and special fighting tight undies everyone but Keith ‚ÄúMr my dick is bulging too much because I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô2 guy who‚Äôs gonna be a lawyer, omg feel sorry for me.‚Äù Pathetic. I actually remmeber at his 16 th birthday it was really funny when we caught his dad kissing the dog naked. He was thrown in jail and Keith was thrown into a downward spiral. By now it‚Äôs clear Keith blows cock, I wanna watch his tight asshole rot and turn to rust with a huge iron cock keeping it bloody in Guantonomo bay. But yea hope you enjoyed the story about Keith, sorry he just sucks even his priest won‚Äôt see him. Father mikey said he‚Äôd rather suck Satan off dry than see Keith again. Keith blows."

863,"A brunette, a blonde, and a bleached blonde (born dirty blonde, but resents her mother who shares the same natural features) find themselves inside GreatClips for their appointments","A brunette, a blonde, and a bleached dyed blonde (born dirty blonde, but she never likes to talk about it even though she obviously isn‚Äôt naturally bleach) find themselves inside GreatClips for their appointments 

The brunette walks in first, the blonde second, and finally the bleache makes her way in. They are all wearing typical crop tops and sandals and little purses where their wallets carrying the money they will pay with are. 


The hairdresser Stew, a white man that has no feet, used to work there until someone broke in and savagely cut his feet off with clippers. The man who attacked him was confirmed to have been high on meth and after went to go murder a nursery of kittens with bare hands. Just kidding, he ate them. 

His daughter Stewie, is now taking over and will be somehow orchestrating all appointments at once. However, what really sucks for her career outlook in the future with this industry is that she is already showing early signs of Parkinson‚Äôs in a field where hands are extremely important. She eventually hangs herself because all she ever wanted to do was cut people‚Äôs hair. 

The brunette springs up and gets ready to hustle over to the chair. She lowkey toots out of excitement. This does not please the hairdresser. She mumbles, ‚ÄúNext pleas‚Äù as the Xanax starts to work its magic

The blonde jolts up and sings slowly that‚Äôs me and does a little stupid Disney channel-ass pose. The guy with no feet thinks to himself he wished the meth man had cut out his eyes as well. He makes a mental note to potentially get into heroin and give up on life beginning tonight but then remembers he has a sick mother to care for.

She gets her hair washed and smells like roses. She goes and sits down and Snapchat‚Äôs Joey, her boyfriend. Joey usually would be there with her mostly all the time, however, he recently got in a car accident and lost both of his legs out of bad luck so he‚Äôs in a wheelchair and the blonde does not have a wheelchair accessible vehicle yet and her father is very on her about being responsible and mature. Joey Snapchat‚Äôs a picture of the chair and says haha were twins right now baby chair twins. The bleached blonde embarrassed to admit it, does not see herself being able to be his wife in the future. This really screws Joey up and his positive improvement he made mentally since his accident.

The brunette is sort of mad, but still happy to finally get her hair cut. She asks for like 6 consecutively different haircuts, making her xanax‚Äôd out hairdresser wonder what is wrong with her logic. She inevitably ends up having her haircut being carried out till she was left with a buzz. She‚Äôs crying and does not know how it happened and where her hair went. This is when the two hairdressers begin to pack up for the last time ever. They‚Äôve been their since ‚Äò98 and were planning on doing a vacation in Savannah, Georgia next September, for about a week or so to get away and see some different settings.

The brunette and blonde are about to pay but then forget that the bleache blonde has been just sitting there and was never serviced with a haircut or shampoo. 

They both say together (after about 12 attempts of trying to coordinate their voices simultaneously, pissing everyone off there) why don‚Äôt you get yourself something special? The bleache blonde is not letting up she is still looking at her phone, smacking her gum looking like a total diva. She has skin tone lipstick on.

They then go up to her and say they will leave and meet later with her after she‚Äôs done. Pissed off, bleached blonde takes out her governmentally administered taser and tases patient 1-332 and patient 1-333 of the local insane asylum. The blonde was schizophrenic and imagined her shampooing and the brunette is addicted to meth and heroine/coke and killed her family but denies it in her subconscious, spiraling her into  a state of psychosis in which she will never break out of. The bleache blonde, you guessed it, does not have any issues except for minor Asthma, however, she is very on top of her health and her doctor applauds her every checkup on it. The only thing that is sad for bleached blonde is that she is only attracted to dogs deep down. This impacts her life tremendously, as she envisions a world with a husband she cannot have that is not of her species. 

Now it is more apparent why the hairdressers get so stressed and resorted to Xanax on the night of their fatal accident. The 2 patients were really not pleasant and the government bleache blonde just naturally gives them anxiety. They sense she craves something that is frowned upon, maybe she likes a dog. Hmm.

Later that night, the bleache blonde before she leaves, messes with the hairdressers car in order to make the crash seem like it was bc of Xanax and not because she broke the brake. She is now a psychopath she realizes and decides fuck her job, time to get busy. She spends all her money, destroys her possessions, and begins her stage by stage transmission in careers. The 2 patients walk free for two days before wandering on a farm where they were shot during the night as they were mistaken for trespassing robbers. 

GreatClips is so upset, but everything turns out fine for them, though, because they realize they were trying to relocate that location anyways and they didn‚Äôt have to awkwardly fire them anymore. They‚Äôre deep down embarrassed to be so soft.

1033,have you heard of eczema?,"I, and many others suffer from a skin condition known as atopic dermatitis, or more commonly as eczema. Eczema affects around 15 million Americans, and is much more common in younger people. Eczema causes a rash to appear, especially on the inside of your knees and elbows, and in more severe cases on other places such as the face. For some people, like me, eczema can be seasonal and flare up more when it becomes warmer or colder. For me, it gets worse in the winter and summer, when it is typically rather hot or cold. Because of this, for some people it is not nearly as hard to deal with in the early-mid spring, or autumn. At times it can be unpredictable whether it will flare up or not. It can go from nothing, to extremely painful overnight. Atopic dermatitis can be easily prevented by moisturizing daily, or applying an anti-itch cream or ointment to the affected area at the first signs of it. However, when it begins to be painful and easily noticeable, the only way to get rid of it is to wait for it to die down, and possibly apply bandages to discourage scratching.

1051,A Story about Lost Soulmates,"Meet Bob.

He is a lonely man in his thirties, living in Chicago. Although he doesn't ever want to have kids, he eventually wants to get married, and his last relationship was years ago. 

One day, he spots a beautiful woman on the L train named Christine. He musters the courage to approach her, and the two chat the rest of her train ride. They eventually get off the train and have a fun night together. However, an unfortunate mishap occurs the next morning. As Bob tries asking for Christine's number so he can see her again, she explains she has to has to leave abruptly due to a emergency at work. It's OK, he thinks to himself. He'll see her on the L tomorrow. 

But the next day, he doesn't see Christine. Or the next. Or the next. Over the next couple years. As he continues to not see her on the train, he dives into a depression, feeling like he missed out on his soulmate. His life spirals further when he's fired from his job due to his sadness and his lack of motivation to work. 

His life begins to turn around, however, where he sees Christine on the L! Except, as he walks up to her, he realizes that it's a woman that looks almost exactly like Christine, but isn't her. He starts talking to this woman and learns that she's Christine's identical twin, Susie. Susie excitedly tells Bob that Christine has talked longingly about Bob before, wishes she gave him her number, and she now lives in Denver. Susie suggests that he should travel to Denver and reconnect with her (she'll get the OK from Christine first, but she thinks Christine would be excited). 

Bob, ecstatic, readies himself for his journey. He hasn't had a job since he was fired years prior, and he's ready to turn his life around. So, he drives the camper he's been living in the past few years through the Midwest until he reaches Colorado. Unfortunately, his camper breaks down right before the ascent through the mountains to Denver. Determined, Bob gets out of his camper and spends the next month walking through the mountains. He grows a beard, loses his shoes and twenty pounds, and feels miserable because of the never ending rain. However, he eventually makes it to Denver. Knowing he looks awful, he immediately finds a local YMCA, shaves and takes a shower, and walks to Christine's house (after Susie got the OK from Christine, Susie gave Bob her address). He takes a deep breath, ready to meet the woman he's been longing for the past few years, and knocks on the door. Christine, still looking great, opens the door. 

They both smile, recognizing each other. However, fear strikes Bob when he sees Christine holding the hands of a four year old toddler who looks like a miniature version of Bob. Christine says ""Your Bob Goldsmith, from the L in Chicago, right? My sister told me she talked to you."" What does Bob says, staring frighteningly at the toddler, freaked about about his possible son?

1114,The Black community's views on Eminem:," 

I read a bit about what Lord Jamar was saying about how Black people wouldn't like Eminem, and his argument was absolute trash. He talks as though Gangster rap is the only valid part of hip hop. Eminem sometimes talks about street shit, but he talks about personal struggles more, like racism he faced, being bullied, having batshit crazy mom and a deadbeat dad, etc.

To say that just because he's not a ""gangster"", Black people won't take him seriously is sort of racist in itself, after all not every single black person is from the ghetto.

The one thing that I think could resonate poorly with black people would be him cursing out his own mother in the past. I was watching Mindhunter, and FBI agent Tench said Blacks and Hispanics would be too respectful of older women in their own community to commit violent crimes against them, and the that they should investigate white trailer trash instead. In the end the murderer was a white trash dude.

The same thing could apply here. When Blueface did something that appears to be mistreating their mom, he had to go on radio shows to clear the air.

Trump turned out to be a wonderful, reasonable leader who brought the country together and eradicated Covid-19 while stimulating the economy and lifting the middle class, and alleviating extreme poverty. The environment improved, as did our relationships with allies and foes alike. Americans gleefully aligned around sensible healthcare and immigration policies that were both affordable and effective, and the national debt was eliminated thanks to across-the-aisle agreements to balance the budget.

1750,A man walks into a bar...,"... he says ""Ow.""

The thing is, he knows that the old pull-up bar is hanging on the frame to the basement door. It's been there for years. But he... forgot it, somehow? Didn't duck, went full speed right into it, forehead first. There's a ringing in his ears, the vision in his left eye blurring. ""Just rung my bell again."" 

The memory problems started about ten years ago. It didn't make sense - he was only in his thirties. There was no history of mental weakness in his family, yet here he was, forgetting why he left the house, forgetting anniversaries. Judith! Right, Judy could help him get back up the stairs. ""Honey, I'm feeling a little dizzy here..."" 

No answer came, of course. She left him three years ago. She tried, good lord she tried so hard. But the mood swings and night terrors and uncharacteristic, unpredictable violent rages were too much. The man she loved was being hallowed out before her eyes, lost atom by atom to coalescing black holes of degenerating grey matter.

The pain of his loneliness came rushing back into him, as if anew, but probably for the hundredth time. The pain in his head was now joined by one in his heart. She left him just like they all left him. The doctors and their lies. ""CTE my ass.""

He was an athlete! Playing the O-Line was relatively anonymous, but his peers knew him well. He had raw power tempered by affability, a gentle giant of good humor and greater football IQ. His job was to be a tank, absorb the hits, which he did with ease. There were dozens of concussions he knew about - often shrugged off after the impartial medical advice of coaches who would assure him that he just ""rung his bell."" There were uncountable subconcussive hits. He endured the bloodsport for twenty years, with nothing left to show for it but chronic traumatic encephalopathy. 

The money is gone, family and friends are gone, memory is gone, health is gone. But he's got the bottle, thank god he's got the bottle. Judith tried to get him to stop, the doctors all said it wasn't helping, but what the fuck do they know?! Alcohol is the only thing helping right now. 

Ach, the gin. That's why he came downstairs. He can't stand gin, but he's out of everything else and the credit cards are frozen. He turns around to go back down, muttering that Judith should just go to the liquor store. Maybe he didn't see it, maybe he forgot:

The man she loved was being hallowed out before her eyes, lost atom by atom to coalescing black holes of degenerating grey matter.

The pain of his loneliness came rushing back into him, as if anew, but probably for the hundredth time. The pain in his head was now joined by one in his heart. She left him just like they all left him. The doctors and their lies. ""CTE my ass.""

He was an athlete! Playing the O-Line was relatively anonymous, but his peers knew him well. He had raw power tempered by affability, a gentle giant of good humor and greater football IQ. His job was to be a tank, absorb the hits, which he did with ease. There were dozens of concussions he knew about - often shrugged off after the impartial medical advice of coaches who would assure him that he just ""rung his bell."" There were uncountable subconcussive hits. He endured the bloodsport for twenty years, with nothing left to show for it but chronic traumatic encephalopathy. 

The money is gone, family and friends are gone, memory is gone, health is gone. But he's got the bottle, thank god he's got the bottle. Judith tried to get him to stop, the doctors all said it wasn't helping, but what the fuck do they know?! Alcohol is the only thing helping right now. 

Ach, the gin. That's why he came downstairs. He can't stand gin, but he's out of everything else and the credit cards are frozen. He turns around to go back down, muttering that Judith should just go to the liquor store. Maybe he didn't see it, maybe he forgot:

A man walks into a bar...

And he slumps to the ground, weeping, while the walls yell at him to man up."

1787,A horse walks into a bar,"A horse walks into a bar and the bartender asks, ‚Äúwhy the long face?‚Äù

The horse says, ""hypothetically, imagine that through whatever course of human evolution, for some reason when men ejaculate, entire babies are shot out. Let's also imagine that these babies need to be placed in a woman in order to germinate completely, so this doesn't change the overall process of having a child at all. In fact, these babies are quite small, maybe only a tablespoon in volume. Only one can come out in any given session unless you've been edging for a while or are more pent up than usual. They swim up the fallopian tubes as sperm would, and the woman's body knows how to plug them into their uterine lining somehow. The babies cannot survive on their own outside of a womb for much more than, say, five minutes. In those five minutes, they are much like fish out of water. Flopping about, doing the only thing their as of yet undeveloped neural systems know how to do: trying to swim up. Eventually, they die, and you're left with a grape-sized humanoid smeared on whatever sheet, or sock, or person‚Äôs back you're partial to leaving such things on. 

""In such a world, would abortion be more, or less accepted? On the one hand, we have complete proof that these fetuses have some sort of mental capacity. They are capable of surviving, at least for a short time, and can react to stimuli. They can even make moderately intelligent choices in order to navigate their way through the female anatomy, otherwise, they would 'get lost' and the human species would promptly become sterile. Following this thread, it seems like we would be less likely to allow abortions. With the image of someone literally shooting a baby into someone, it seems humans, in general, would decide that there is enough sapience there that we couldn't kill it. It seems in this scenario that paradoxically life begins before conception. Being kicked in the balls would near genocide, the equivalent of kicking a satchel full of children with a steel-toed boot.

""On the other hand, it may be that we get entirely jaded to the idea of abortion. Every adolescent male would have had to kill thousands upon thousands of fetuses before they turned twenty! The experience of having a wet dream would be even more disturbing, as instead of waking up to a mild stickiness in your sheets, you wake up snuggled up to the corpse of a child. Imagine walking to your child's door, and without warning, you enter his room. Find him hastily hiding the smashed pulp of a fetus he just had to euthanize would be no different than the snapping shut of a laptop now. It almost seems like in this universe we would justify abortions more easily, as all the world's men--who seem to be the biggest proponents of the pro-life argument--would have spent their adolescence performing abortions on themselves every day. 

""The argument could certainly be made that if a grape-sized child came out of you every time you took yourself on a j-date maybe people would take the Catholic church's rules about ""spilling your seed"" a little more seriously, but I think the level of horniness in teenage boys would still outweigh any misguided or otherwise moral compass on masturbation. And what else can they do afterward? It's more cruel not to snap your semen's little spine. Otherwise, it's just going to die from exposure! This is more or less how it is in our universe. Every time one ejaculates, in a way, millions upon millions of potential human lives die of exposure to the hostile elements. The only real difference is they are smaller and look less humanoid. 

""Porn would also take an interesting turn. I'm curious if something like bukkake would still have a place in this universe. Would people still want to watch a woman swallow? Would the bisexual women involved in threesomes kiss a more and more mangled, chewed up baby back and forth only for both of them to swallow pieces of it? How would anal sex work? What happens if you don't pull out, and a baby is just lodged in your large intestine? How much would these babies be fetishized in general? It seems that nearly everything, fluid or excretion related, sexual or not, has a community dedicated to the fetishization of it. If we live in a world with foot fetishists, and individuals obsessed with water or bloodplay, it's harder to believe people wouldn't be into sexualizing their undercooked baby excrement.

""The issue of premature ejaculation is another interesting one in this universe. Imagine being on a date with a cute girl, things are going well, she keeps touching your arms and thighs when she laughs. Long story short, there‚Äôs a lot of stimulation going on. Finally, you‚Äôre back in her apartment under the pretense of getting some 1 AM coffee (which is a tradition I don‚Äôt really understand. Sex or not, do people really want to be drinking coffee that late? That‚Äôs just irresponsible). You guys are kissing and cuddling, tongues are moving around--look, this isn't my personal erotica, you can fill in the gaps. One thing leads to another, and you tense up. All of a sudden you and this poor, poor girl look down. She was alerted by a sudden sensation of frantic movement coming from your crotch. The bulge that was there has been replaced with a softer, smaller one, and a bulge that‚Äôs flopping around as if you had a water balloon containing a goldfish strapped to your leg, and it suddenly popped. In this universe, you both know what‚Äôs just occurred. Instead of terror because there‚Äôs a tiny creature (hell, maybe two or three, she was pretty hot) swimming down your pant-leg, you feel embarrassed that you let it out this early. If you try again before a few hours have passed, you‚Äôll just shoot out an arm or a leg, which sucks because unbeknownst to you, this girl is particularly into baby-play. Too bad.

2294,Why was 6 afraid of 7?,"6 wasn't afraid of 7. 7 wasn't afraid of 6. They're numbers, they're not sentient, they're not even alive. Numbers can't fear, cry, smile, or care. Humans personalize these numbers for the burst of dopamine in their empty lives called humor, and if you really want this humor, take it.

Life will go on, while these numbers can't feel, we can! We deserve this happiness in our lives, there's nothing wrong with it, all it is is a few simple words to make someone feel slightly better.

Except, they're not. It's a very common few simple words, if they've heard it they may not laugh again, they might not have even laughed the first time. It's not a magic spell you cast upon someone to make them enjoy themselves. How are these three words going to change anything in the grand scheme of things? Life is uncontrollable, sometimes things happen and you can't stop them, and life is unpredictable. You'll never see it coming, so the real question is is it better to try in case it works, or to not in case it backfires?

This, however, *is* controllable. I was lying when I said life was uncontrollable, and I was lying when I said it was unpredictable. Sure, you can't control everything all by yourself, but the amount of effort a human being can put into it, could just make a small change. These changes could create domino effects, and change the world entirely. If you have a plan, you can do it. So, what's your plan? Do you wanna hear the punchline, or would you rather scroll on with your day on the internet?

It's entirely up to you. You can stop reading if you want, or you can go on.

No, they're not created by mice, they're created with this whole explanation that I don't want to write out because that would take too long. (Although to be honest this is going to take longer than that.)

There are also Swiss chocolates, which aren't in my opinion as good as Belgium chocolate but it's still good. I mean, any type of chocolate is good I guess. If you don't like chocolate or are allergic to it, that's your decision but let me just tell you, *you're missing out.*

Additionally, there are Swiss Army Knives which are very useful and are something you should always have included in your paraphernalia. Very portable, helpful, and can potentially protect you if someone's attempting to mug you for some strange reason. Also something you might want to have if you're a Boy Scout or something like that.

Furthermore, the Swiss Alps are pretty great. They're known for skiing and snowboarding and stuff like that, but aside from all of that you gotta love how they look.

2339,A joke involving colors,"So some back story before I tell my joke.  There is a town with three rules:

1.  Everyone in the town has a last name of a color.  Yellow, Red, Blue, you get the idea.

2.  Everyone has possessions of their color.  Yellow car, yellow suit, yellow shoes, you get the idea.

3.  Everyone is deathly afraid to be alone on the streets in the dark.  They will seek out shelter with total strangers to avoid this.

One night, Ms. White is watching Wheel of Fortune on the TV.  It's getting late so she decides to turn in for the night.  She hears a knock on the door.  Looking out the window, she sees a yellow Lamborghini on fire.  Mr. Yellow is at the door.  ""I need a place to stay for the night, I'll call a tow truck first thing in the morning.""  Ms. White say ""fine, first door on the right"".

Not wanting to go to sleep right away, Ms. White stays up a little longer just to check if anyone else would come along.  Sure enough, about ten minutes later, another knock on the door.  Looking out, she sees a purple minivan spewing out black smoke.  Mrs. Purple is at the door, and asks to stay the night, promising to call a tow truck in the morning.  ""Fine.  Second door on the right"" Ms White said, thinking this situation was quite strange.

So, after two guests arrived exactly 10 minutes apart, Ms. White decided to stay up and see if another guest would arrive.  Sure enough, ten minutes exactly, another knock on the door.  It's a red civic, but unlike the other two vehicles, this one is just plain dead.  Ms. Red is at the door, asking to stay the night, promising to call a tow truck in the morning.  ""Sure thing.  Third door on the right"".

Having no more spare bedrooms, Ms. White decides to go to her bedroom, the first door on the left.

The next morning, Mr. Yellow wakes up, goes into the kitchen, and pours himself a bowl of Rice Krispies.

Mrs. Purple wakes up, goes to the kitchen, and pours herself a bowl of Rice Krispies

Ms. Red wakes up, goes to the kitchen, and pours herself a bowl of Rice Krispies

Ms. White wakes up, goes to the kitchen, and pours herself a bowl of Corn Flakes.

And that is why 3 out of 4 people prefer Rice Krispies to Corn Flakes.",AntiJokes,1608589495,captkrisma,2,1,True,"A joke involving colors So some back story before I tell my joke.  There is a town with three rules:

1.  Everyone in the town has a last name of a color.  Yellow, Red, Blue, you get the idea.

2.  Everyone has possessions of their color.  Yellow car, yellow suit, yellow shoes, you get the idea.

3.  Everyone is deathly afraid to be alone on the streets in the dark.  They will seek out shelter with total strangers to avoid this.

One night, Ms. White is watching Wheel of Fortune on the TV.  It's getting late so she decides to turn in for the night.  She hears a knock on the door.  Looking out the window, she sees a yellow Lamborghini on fire.  Mr. Yellow is at the door.  ""I need a place to stay for the night, I'll call a tow truck first thing in the morning.""  Ms. White say ""fine, first door on the right"".

Not wanting to go to sleep right away, Ms. White stays up a little longer just to check if anyone else would come along.  Sure enough, about ten minutes later, another knock on the door.  Looking out, she sees a purple minivan spewing out black smoke.  Mrs. Purple is at the door, and asks to stay the night, promising to call a tow truck in the morning.  ""Fine.  Second door on the right"" Ms White said, thinking this situation was quite strange.

So, after two guests arrived exactly 10 minutes apart, Ms. White decided to stay up and see if another guest would arrive.  Sure enough, ten minutes exactly, another knock on the door.  It's a red civic, but unlike the other two vehicles, this one is just plain dead.  Ms. Red is at the door, asking to stay the night, promising to call a tow truck in the morning.  ""Sure thing.  Third door on the right"".

Having no more spare bedrooms, Ms. White decides to go to her bedroom, the first door on the left.

The next morning, Mr. Yellow wakes up, goes into the kitchen, and pours himself a bowl of Rice Krispies.

2343,WARNING: 18+," 

I was sitting alone in my bedroom at my computer. It had been 12 days since my last shower and 6 days since I last slept. The only thing keeping me awake was the stench of my body odor being circulated around my room by the jet engine that was my RTX 3080 Founders Edition. But why was I keeping myself awake for so long? It was to write saucy pasta for [r/copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/). Any second I was asleep was time I was not writing pasta, and not making opportunities to get comments from my one true love, Cummy.

Before Cummy, I was a sexless husk. Even though I had been through puberty, no sexual desire ever overtook me. For the longest time I assumed I was asexual. I cried every night from the sadness of missing out on a human experience. During one of my sobbing sessions I came across the [r/copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/) subreddit and decided to write a pasta about jelqing while I had a banana up my ass. As soon as I posted, I got an instant comment.

‚ÄúIs my post already popular? Who would care about my work this much?‚Äù I thought to myself.

I checked the comment and that‚Äôs when I saw him for the first time, Cummy. He had written my pasta word for word, as is in spirit with copypastas. The fact that he had done this so quickly filled me with joy. Not only that, but there was another feeling, some kind of internal spark that I had never felt before. I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was but I knew that I wanted to feel it again. The only way to achieve that was to write more pasta.

Day after day I posted more and more pasta on the subreddit. Sounding, school shootings, Ben Shapiro, Fortnite fart porn, any topic I could think of. Anything that was worthy of another post. Each time, Cummy would reply within seconds and trigger the feeling. Not only that, but the feeling seemed to grow each time. Had I really discovered it? Was this‚Ä¶ love?

And that‚Äôs how I ended up in my cycle of sleepless nights. I just wanted to see his username pop up on my screen for the small piece of human connection that was missing in my life. The pain was dulled by the ecstasy of my connection with Cummy. I thought this would last forever, but that would not be the happy ending to my love story.

I sat at my PC one morning with a fresh new pasta idea. The hosts of Masterchef Australia force feeding George spicy crab and then licking the sweat off his bald head. A bit out there, but I‚Äôm sure it would give Cummy a chuckle. I posted and waited. One second, two seconds, three. I started to shiver.

‚ÄúMaybe Reddit‚Äôs servers are being a bit slow? I know their system admins spend most of their days snorting cocaine so the site sometimes keks itself.‚Äù

One minute. 5 minutes. An hour. Two hours. I went into full panic mode wondering where my love was. I browsed the front page of the sub to see if anyone knew where Cummy was. That‚Äôs when I saw the post. Cummy was dead.

I couldn‚Äôt read the rest of the post. I didn‚Äôt need to know the reason. All I knew was that my love was gone. I didn‚Äôt shout, I didn‚Äôt cry. I just stared blankly into the void. At that moment, my body seemed to take over. I stood up and walked out of my bedroom without my brain being involved. It felt like instinct was kicking in. I walked down the stairs and into the kitchen. I stood over my dog‚Äôs corpse who had died of starvation, walked through the pile of rat feces and went straight to the drawers. I opened the top drawer and pulled out the biggest knife in the pile. I held it against my neck and was ready to slash. I guess deep down, I knew this was the only way I‚Äôd see Cummy again. I closed my eyes and prepared myself for the brief pain. But that‚Äôs when I heard it.

‚ÄúNot so fast!‚Äù I heard a voice shout. This confused me greatly. I didn‚Äôt live with anyone since my parents moved out and ran to Tahiti to get away from their disappointment of a son. I opened my eyes and looked in the direction of the voice. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust through the thin layer of tears. When my eyes focused, I saw before me a larger man dressed as the Flash. Although overweight, he somehow triggered a feeling of lust deep within me.

‚ÄúI hear you‚Äôre a big fan‚Äù said the gentleman.

These words confused me, but only after a few seconds did I realise. Standing in front of me was my love, Cummy.

I dropped the knife and ran straight into his muscular arms.

‚ÄúCummy, I thought you were dead!‚Äù I cried, tears seeping into his suit.

He explained. ‚ÄúHaha! Many people did. But it was faked. I felt that I had to move on from Reddit.‚Äù

‚ÄúBu-... But why would you do such a thing? You scared us all!‚Äù I asked.

He leaned into my ear and whispered ‚ÄúTo be with you, of course.‚Äù

These words shocked me to the bone. I never thought that I‚Äôd have love in my life. Not only that, but it also triggered something else completely new. I felt movement in my pants, a kind I had never experienced. I looked down and I saw it. I had gotten my first erection. Not only that, it was poking into Cummy‚Äôs thigh. He felt it against himself and looked down.

‚ÄúNow look what we have here‚Äù he whispered lustfully. He placed his hand on my leg and stroked it upwards towards my groin.

‚ÄúIs this really happening Cummy? It‚Äôs all so fast.‚Äù I said. I voiced concern, but this was mostly an act. I‚Äôd let Cummy do anything to me. He quickly grabbed me around my shaft.

‚ÄúOh yes it is.‚Äù he said.

This was the moment where it started. He didn‚Äôt stroke, he didn‚Äôt tease. Instead, he started to rotate me around him. While this took me by surprise, it was a greatly pleasurable experience. While I was trying to keep pace with the motion on my feet, the speed eventually increased too greatly for this. My feet came off the floor. I was being spun around by my cock in the air. Cummy started spinning even faster. Eventually, the movement of myself around him created a propeller-like updraft. This caused Cummy himself to start rising off the floor. We rose so high that we almost hit the ceiling.

‚ÄúAre you ready for the finale?‚Äù he asked. I braced myself.

‚ÄúYes Cummy, do it.‚Äù

He performed one final spin with great force.

‚ÄúSO LONG, GAY BOWSER!‚Äù

He released me from his hand and launched me at supersonic speeds. This caused me to release a jet engine force of cum out of my penis. Cummy crossed his arms in front of himself to block the shot, but the force still caused him to be pushed back along the floor.

I shot through the walls of all the rooms in my own house and the neighbouring houses. I went through multiple kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms, each leaving a perfect silhouette hole in the wall. I eventually made my way through all the buildings and out into the open. My forceful jizz cannon caused me to fly sporadically in the air. I looked over and saw another person flying using cock-force. They seemed to be able to control their flight though. I pushed my erect penis downward and locked it between my legs. By holding my arms outward and moving my hips, I was able to now fly gracefully through the air. The other person flew towards me.

‚ÄúWho let you release?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI had a run-in with Owoifier and‚Ä¶ you can say he ‚Äòtook me for a spin‚Äô‚Äù he responded.

We both chuckled and continued to fly. We span around each other, creating beautiful jizz patterns in the air. Children ran to their windows to look at the beauty. Many made wishes upon us, assuming we were some magical force. However, all beauty must come to an end.

Myself and my new friend started to feel the pressure from our penises dim and putter.

‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôre about out‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYes‚Äù he responded. ‚ÄúLooks like this is about to come to a close.‚Äù

We turned upwards and held each other in our arms. We flew in front of the moon as the last of our fuel diminished. We started to fall. We had no plans for a soft landing, our lives were complete.

The police found our bodies the next day. We were piled on each other in the middle of the road, covered in blood and man butter. A sheet was pulled over our bodies. A crowd had gathered to see what had happened. At the back of the crowd however, stood Cummy. He saw that his work was done.

2360,There was a businessman whose wife was REALLY into sex,"### He was a hardworking guy but still managed to satisfy his wife's needs.

One  time he had to leave for another country for a business meet. He  would've been gone for a week. He knew his wife's sex drive and didn't  want to take risks so he thought he should gift her something so she can  satisfy herself and doesn't think about searching for a new partner so  he went to an adult toy shop.

As  soon as he entered the first thing he saw was a blow up doll but soon  dismissed the thought of buying it since it's almost like another human,  he then proceeded to the dildos section.

There  he saw all kinds of dildos, from massive to tiny to ones which glow in  the dark but none of them grabbed his interest so he decided he'll go  somewhere else and begins to leave the shop when he was stopped by the  owner sitting behind the cash counter.

""I know what you're looking for"", the owner says

This grabbed the businessman's attention and he stopped to hear what the owner had to say.

""There  was a man many years ago who looked just like you, wealthy but tired.  He had a wife whom he couldn't satisfy and she was about to leave him  when he came here and got my help. He's happily married since then""

""How exactly did you help him?"" Asked the businessman.

The  cashier bent down and revealed an engraved wooden box from under the  counter. There were all sorts of symbols on the box. He opens it and  inside it was a pink latex dildo, similar to the ones on the shelf.

""This  is an ancient artifact haunted by a Maori tribe who all died of sex  deprivation when all the women of their village were killed in a plague,  all their souls now reside in this dildo"", said the owner.

The businessman being a sceptical guy laughed and then turns to leave.

The owner says, ""You're all the same, thinking there's nothing above this material plane of existence. Watch this.""

The businessman turns around.

""Voodoo Dildo, keyhole""

To  his astonishment, the businessman saw the box violently shake and the  dildo rise in the air, float for a second and hover over to the keyhole  in the front door and start to fuck it. The dildo fucked the keyhole  with such force that the door unhinged and started cracking.

""Voodoo Dildo, box""

The dildo stops fucking the door and returns to the box.

""ILL TAKE IT"", screamed the businessman, and after a lot of negotiation he finally purchased the dildo and ran home.

He  tells his wife about the dildo and how to use it. ""Voodoo Dildo, pussy.  That's how you activate it"", the businessman told his wife and went on  his business trip.

After 3 days of  being horny the wife finally gave into her urges and opened the wooden  box, took out the dildo and uttered ""Voodoo Dildo, pussy"". The dildo  shot from her hands and started fucking her. First slowly and then  changing speed as the way she wanted.

After  an hour of fucking, the wife thought it was enough and she grabbed the  dildo. But it didn't stop fucking her. Her husband had forgot to tell  her how to stop the dildo. She started panicking and called him but he  didn't pick up so she started to dress up and go for the hospital, all  the while the dildo still fucking her.

She  got in her car and started driving. On the way she had a huge orgasm  and her car served and almost hit another car. A police car saw this and  she was stopped at the side of the highway. A policeman approached her.

""Ma'am you almost hit the grey SUV back there, have you been drinking?""

The wife then proceeds to tell him all about her husband and the voodoo Dildo and that she can't stop it now.

The policeman then says,

""Yeah right, I'm placing you under arrest.""",AntiJokes,1608510975,Allevon,0,1,True,"There was a businessman whose wife was REALLY into sex ### He was a hardworking guy but still managed to satisfy his wife's needs.

To  his astonishment, the businessman saw the box violently shake and the  dildo rise in the air, float for a second and hover over to the keyhole  in the front door and start to fuck it. The dildo fucked the keyhole  with such force that the door unhinged and started cracking.

""Voodoo Dildo, box""

The dildo stops fucking the door and returns to the box.

""ILL TAKE IT"", screamed the businessman, and after a lot of negotiation he finally purchased the dildo and ran home.

He  tells his wife about the dildo and how to use it. ""Voodoo Dildo, pussy.  That's how you activate it"", the businessman told his wife and went on  his business trip.

After 3 days of  being horny the wife finally gave into her urges and opened the wooden  box, took out the dildo and uttered ""Voodoo Dildo, pussy"". The dildo  shot from her hands and started fucking her. First slowly and then  changing speed as the way she wanted.

After  an hour of fucking, the wife thought it was enough and she grabbed the  dildo. But it didn't stop fucking her. Her husband had forgot to tell  her how to stop the dildo. She started panicking and called him but he  didn't pick up so she started to dress up and go for the hospital, all  the while the dildo still fucking her.

She  got in her car and started driving. On the way she had a huge orgasm  and her car served and almost hit another car. A police car saw this and  she was stopped at the side of the highway. A policeman approached her.

""Ma'am you almost hit the grey SUV back there, have you been drinking?""

The wife then proceeds to tell him all about her husband and the voodoo Dildo and that she can't stop it now.

The policeman then says,

""Yeah right, I'm placing you under arrest."""

The second man hits back and so begins a fist fight, even though both men are strictly forbidden from fighting as per bar rules.¬†

""The first man pulls out a flaming sword and slices the second man in half, killing him instantly. In the original telling of this joke, the sword is made out of fire and the second man is made out of cake but lets not make this any more complicated than it needs to be. The fact of the matter is that the complexity of a joke is, of course, inversely proportional to the magnitude of the punchline, and when this punchline is finally delivered, it will render half of the audience impotent, and the other half wishing that they were.¬†

Now, if I may continue: the first man finishes his whiskey, lights a cigarette and says, 'this entire scene has been a carefully orchestrated prank, engineered by none other than the Prank Master Extraordinaire himself: Stubbles Mc Flap n' Tap."" The two bar employees burst into the room with automatic rifles and unload into the first bar patron, leaving only his flaming sword and his final words: ""no, I'm not on fire, you're the one who is on fire!""¬†

A careful reader might read this and wonder: what were the final words of the other patron who died a gratuitous cake death at the hands of a flaming sword man? And therein lies the beauty of this joke. You see, the other patron was never given any last words because those words weren't essential to the telling of this story.¬†

As it turns out, the cosmetic background details that give life to the characters in this story -- who they are, where they work, who they spend their time with, and so on -- are actually the least important features of a joke. They're omitted for the sake of convenience, as we need not fill the mind of readers with irrelevant trivia that ultimately doesn't relate to some grand truth or useful narrative about the world. And yet, these omitted trivialities are quite literally of life-or-death importance to the characters I have so callously censored. The sad fact is that not every character plays an essential role in an interesting story; not every character is part of the punchline; and and not every character has last words worth repeating.

I wonder if our own existence is not too different from theirs, and whether our punchline will one day too arrive. When that day comes, will we be remembered as an irrelevant side character whose life story is omitted as a favor to the reader?

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúI have what‚Äôs known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm small down there. I‚Äôm actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.‚Äù
And the guy feels sorry for him. So he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWhere do you think that comes from?‚Äù
And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn‚Äôt tell her. I think it‚Äôs wrapped up in that somehow.‚Äù

And the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúHave you ever seen anyone about this?‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúOh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface.‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúTell me more about that.‚Äù And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.
And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, ‚ÄúHe was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs horrible.‚Äù
And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúYou know what? I‚Äôm over it. He always said I wouldn‚Äôt amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I‚Äôm a professional musician!‚Äù
And the pianist starts to laugh, but it‚Äôs a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWhen he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa .¬†.¬†.‚Äù

And then he starts to cry. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúI just wish I‚Äôd had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.‚Äù

And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, ‚ÄúYour genie‚Äôs hard of hearing.‚Äù
And the bartender says, ‚ÄúNo kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?‚Äù


And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, ‚ÄúOh, my God. You didn‚Äôt really want me.‚Äù
And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not like that.‚Äù You know, trying to backpedal.
And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, ‚ÄúOnce an accident, always an accident.‚Äù And he drinks all of his whiskey.
And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúBrian, I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean that.‚Äù
And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, ‚ÄúWell, I didn‚Äôt mean that.‚Äù

And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWhoa, calm down.‚Äù
And the pianist is, like, ‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù And he‚Äôs really drunk, because he‚Äôs only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúFuck you, asshole! Fuck you!‚Äù

And he starts throwing punches, but he‚Äôs too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender‚Äôs arms.
And suddenly he has this revelation. And he‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúMy God, I‚Äôm just like him. I‚Äôm just like him.‚Äù And he starts weeping.
And the bartender‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre better than he was.‚Äù
And the pianist is, like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôm worthless!‚Äù

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, ‚ÄúDamn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You‚Äôre so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.‚Äù
And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.
So the guy, who‚Äôs been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn‚Äôt know the bartender was gay. It doesn‚Äôt bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there‚Äôs the genie.

So the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúHey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.‚Äù

And the genie‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWho says they‚Äôre broken?‚Äù And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.
And the guy‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúWell done.‚Äù
And then the genie says, ‚ÄúThat bartender‚Äôs tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.‚Äù
And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.
And the genie‚Äôs, like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I should‚Äôve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.‚Äù

3465,A man walks into a grocery store to buy some milk,"He is having trouble locating the dairy aisle so he decides to ask an employee for guidance. 

""Excuse me,"" he says as he approaches a young lady wearing a red shirt.

She quickly whips around and replies, ""What?"" in a rather annoyed tone.

The man quickly comes to the conclusion that the lady he approached is not an employee and replies, ""Oh, sorry. I thought you were an employee."" before quickly walking away.

The man continues looking for an employee and ends up stumbling across the dairy aisle on his journey. He fumbles through the various options of 2% milk until he settles on one with the latest expiration date. He is a rather slow consumer of milk and wants to play it safe.

The man makes his way to the front of the store in order to make his purchase. There are only two registers open. One has three guests in line and the other only has two. He decides to wait in the shorter line. As he is waiting he realizes that the other line would have been a better option as he would have already been checked out. Sadly, it is too late to change as more people have queued in each line. 

The man gets his turn to check out as the customer in front of him takes their receipt and heads out of the store. He suddenly realizes that the cashier is actually the same woman he approached earlier. 

A little confused, he asks why she was so short with him when he tried to get assistance.

She replies, ""I'm so sorry, but your voice sounds just like my ex. He has come to the store several times since we broke up trying to get back with me. Also, my dog died yesterday and I'm just feeling a little irritable.""

The man says, ""Oh, that sucks.""

The purchase is quickly finalized, the man thanks the cashier, and he leaves the store. While making his way to his car across the street, the man is quickly hit with a realization that his response to the cashier's troubles may have been a little insensitive. In this introspective moment he is completely unaware that he has stepped directly in front of a city bus traveling approximately 45 miles per hour.

3520,What's a pirate's favorite letter?,"A letter of marque and reprisal (French: lettre de marque; lettre de course) was a government license in the Age of Sail that authorized a private person, known as a privateer or corsair, to attack and capture vessels of a nation at war with the issuer. Once captured, the privateers could then bring the case of that prize before their own admiralty court for condemnation and transfer of ownership to the privateer. A letter of marque and reprisal would include permission to cross an international border to conduct a reprisal (take some action against an attack or injury) and was authorized by an issuing jurisdiction to conduct reprisal operations outside its borders.

Popular among Europeans from the late Middle Ages up to the 19th century, cruising for enemy prizes with a letter of marque was considered an honorable calling that combined patriotism and profit. Such privateering contrasted with attacks and captures of random ships, which was unlicensed and known as piracy; piracy was almost universally reviled. In reality, the differences between privateers and pirates were often at best subtle and at worst a matter of interpretation.

3716,A Shaggy Dog Story - A horse walks into a bar....,"A horse walks into a bar. Heaving a huge sigh, he asks the baraman for a drink and the barman says 

&gt;Why the long face?

The horse scoffs 

&gt;Har har, very funny, like I haven't heard that one a million times before.

He gets up to leave, but the barman stops him.

&gt;Hey man, I'm sorry, look, have a drink on me. Seriously though, what's got you down?

The horse buries his face in his drink for a moment, then looks up with a sigh.

&gt;I've been laid off the force - all my life I'm been a police horse, but the city's so busy now they're all on bikes or motorcycles. I guess I just don't know what to do with myself.

The barman nods along with the horse, wiping a glass as the beast bears its soul. Finally, he speaks.

&gt;Look, mate. I know what you mean. It can be rough losing your purpose - I can't imagine what I'd do if I lost this place (he says, gesturing at the bar). But here's what I've always said: You're more than your job. You can find a new purpose. What else are you into? Didn't you have any dreams before joining the police?

The horse hesitates for a moment.

&gt;Well... (he sighs). I always wanted to play cricket, when I was a foal at least.

Behind him, a patron stifles a laugh, the barman shoots him a lethal look, then turns back to the horse.

&gt;That's perfect - in fact, the local team is having try-outs this week. Mitch, the coach, is an old mate of mine. I'll give him a ring and tell him you're heading by tomorrow arvo.

The horse protests, but the barman shakes his head.

&gt;Mate, trust me, at least give it a go. 

Reluctantly, the horse nods. He finishes his drink in contemplative silence, leaves a $5 on the bench and heads out.

The next day the horse arrives at the cricket grounds. Unsure of what to wear, he rocks up with an ancient wide brimmed cricket hat, the white now almost cream with stains and age.

As he trots past some of the other try-outs, he tries to ignore the snickers and whispered comments. 

Mitch rocks up and greets him with a bombastic slap on the withers and a hearty hello. The horse, meanwhile, is almost too nervous too respond, but brays his appreciation at the chance.

A few hours pass as the horse watches the others try out - most of them kids, none of them as old as he is (In horse years, of course). Most of them seem... way better than he is.

Finally, his turn comes around. Mitch calls out his name then asks

&gt;So, batter or bowler?

&gt;Bowler

The horse replies. He's not even sure he could hold a bat...

Anyway, he steps up, cricket ball in his teeth. He winds his neck back, eyes blazing with determination and...

drops the ball a few meters ahead and half a meter to the side.

&gt;Try again!

Yells mitch, the horse now almost embarassed to death. Reluctantly he picks up the ball.

He focuses, stares down the batters, years on the force hardened him, motivated him. This is his dream!

The ball flies....

about 3 meters to the right, hitting an absent minded fielder square in the jaw.

The kids on the stands erupt with laughter, the horse is mortified.

Mitch furrows his brow, he's honestly never seen somebody so bad at bowling... But... the poor horse needs this, needs something.

He walks over to the horse

&gt;Oh... sorry Mitch, don't worry, I'm leaving.

&gt;Nah mate, come on. Let's give batting a try. It Uhh... Look, it can't be worse than your bowling, come on.

The horse sighs and heads over. He fumbles to try and pick up the bat, barely able to balance it between his front hooves.

By now, the stands are jeering him, shouting his name and mocking him as he tries not to drop the bat.

The bowler eyes him, a half hidden smirk as he winds up. 

He launches a slow ball, barely enough energy to make it to the end of the field. The horse clenches his teeth, arms tighten then...

#CRACK

Wood hits cork and the ball disappears into the distance.

The oval is silent.

The horse is stunned.

Mitch's jaw is wide enough to see his tonsils.

&gt;Uhh... can you do that again?

He asks. The horse baulks for a moment, then nods.

The bowler is serious this time, he's not to be humilated by a horse. He winds up, then pelts it:

The ball flies, spinning and twisting through the air as though possessed. The horse watches it, almost in slow motion.

#CA-RACK!

With nearly enough force to break the bat into splinters, the ball is sent halfway to the stratosphere. The kids in the stands let out a raucous cheer as the ball disappears into the blinding blue sky.

Suffice to say, the horse made his mark and earned his place on the team.

What followed was months of practice, form and running. Mitch knew the horse was completely, almost impossibly bad at bowling and almost as useless at fielding. 

But put him up to bat and there wasn't a ball on earth he couldn't hit for 6. 

He gained a reputation, carrying his team through the amateur season until he was ultimately scouted for pro-play.

Sad to see him go, but excited for his future, Mitch only shed a single tear as he signed the papers. The horse, of course, embraced his coach in a tidal wave of gratitude.

But time moved fast for the horse - the pro season was nothing like his time with his old team. Over time, he improved his fielding skills - granted he usually ran the ball back instead of throwing it, but it worked out more or less. Of course what really mattered was always his batting.

He became something of a Celebrity - ""The Brumby Batter"" - and it wasn't long before he had it all, money, fame, wealth. But most importantly: Purpose.

Still the years wore on, and eventually he retired. The career of a horse is, sadly, a lot shorter than his human team-mates.

It was only a few days into his retirement when he made his way back to that old bar.

He walks inside and the barman greets him like an old friend. The two share stories - highlights from his games, tales of the barman's new wife and wonderful kids. The two joke and laugh into the night.

It's only a few hours before closing when a young Dalmation walks through the doors and sits down.

He sighs and asks for a drink.

The horse leans in towards the bartender and whispers

After they‚Äôve unpacked all their stuff, the four guys go down to the pink pink restaurant to have lunch. The waiter says, ""Welcome to the pink pink restaurant, may I take your order?""

The first friend says, ""I'll take the pink pink burger with a side of pink pink fries.""

The second friend says, ""I'd like the pink pink salad with extra pink pink croutons.""

The third friend says, ""I'll have the pink pink fruit plate.""

Jake says, ""I'll take the pink pink grilled chicken sandwich, please.""

The waiter replies, ""I'm sorry, we are all out of our pink pink chicken.""

Jake says, ""Okay. In that case, I'll have the pink pink fish and chips.""

After around fifteen minutes, their food arrives, and it's some of the best food they've ever tasted. 

After that, they spend the afternoon driving around to different pink pink attractions in the area, like the pink pink mall, the pink pink hunting range and the pink pink minigolf center. For dinner they order pink pink delivery pizza and watch the pink pink playoff game on their pink pink hotel room TV. 

A little while later, they decide to go to bed, and everyone wishes Jake a happy birthday. He thanks them again for helping him have one of his best birthdays in a long time. 

In the morning, Jake goes downstairs to the hotel breakfast room. No one else is there, and there isn't any food to be seen. He sees the guy behind the pink pink desk and asks, ""Do you serve breakfast here?""

‚ÄúWhere are you taking me?‚Äù asks Jake.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all going to the pink pink hotel!‚Äù his friends respond. 
After they‚Äôve been on the highway for a while, the car‚Äôs pink pink GPS says ‚ÄúIn two miles, take the pink pink exit onto the pink pink interstate.‚Äù So they do that, and then after a bit more driving Jake has to go to the bathroom.

His friend grabs a bag of pink pink chips and some pink pink soda, and then they get back into the pink pink van and pull back onto the pink pink interstate. 

After driving all morning, they finally arrive at the pink pink hotel, and as they‚Äôre pulling into the pink pink parking lot, Jake looks out the window at the hotel and says, ‚ÄúWow, this place looks amazing. Thanks, guys!‚Äù
They respond, ‚ÄúNo problem! After all, it is your birthday.‚Äù
They walk into the pink pink lobby and check in with the man at the pink pink front desk. 

The first friend walks up to get his card, and the man hands it to him while saying, ‚ÄúThis is your pink pink room card.

3942,A cowboy walks into a deserted saloon...,"And there's no tinkling waltz on the piano, no gentle buzzing about the days activities, it's empty. A mournful bartender polishes an immaculate glass and halfheartedly waves away a fat, clueless fly.


The cowboy sidled into a stool and fished a coin out of his pocket. He flicked it with his thumb, and it sang in the air before ringing out on the wooden bar.


""Say friend, you got a whiskey?""


The coin rattles to a stop, and the bartender looks up with a patient smile.


""That is,"" says the cowboy, ""if you're not too busy.""


""No sir,"" says the barman. ""Never too busy."" He pops the top off a dark bottle of rye and pours a generous glass.


The cowboy throws it back, licks his lips, and says, ""My, my, my. Doesn't do any good in the bottle, does it?""


""I suppose it doesn't,"" says the bartender.


The fly buzzes by.


""Well!"" says the cowboy, clearly itching for company. ""Where in the Sam Hell is everybody?""


""Oh,"" says the bartender, ""they're all at the hangin'.""


""Hangin'?


""Hangin'.""


The cowboy motions for another belt of brown, and the bartender obliges. 


""Now who might they be hangin' today?""


The bartender puts his rag on his shoulder, looks the cowboy straight in the eye and says, ""Sir, today they're hangin' none other than 'Brown Paper Pete'.""


""Brown Paper Pete?""


""The very same.""


The cowboy points to the now empty glass and makes the international 'just one more' gesture. 


""That's an interesting name, isn't it?""


""It does have an air about it, sir.""


""Now why do you suppose they call him that?""


""Well sir,"" says the bartender, ""they call him 'Brown Paper Pete' because he wears a brown paper hat.""


""Does he now?""


""He does.""


""And if it rains?""


""He wears it all the same.""


""My goodness.""


""That ain't the half of it, sir! See, he also wears himself a brown paper shirt.""


""A shirt?""


""And a brown paper tie. Both of which are firmly ensconced in a well-fitted brown paper frock coat. Do you want me to tell you about his pants?""


""I think I have a pretty fair idea,"" says the cowboy. ""Would it be presumptive of me to assume that they are made of brown paper as well?""


""They are indeed. And he has a nice pair of brown paper boots, and a fine set of brown paper socks.""


""It appears,"" says the cowboy, ""that this outlaw's sobriquet is well-earned!""


""Now I don't know what that specifically means, sir. But I'll wager I agree.""


The cowboy sips in silence.


The fly makes another round.


The bartender goes back to polishing the gleaming glass.


""So!"" says the cowboy. ""What are they hangin' him for?""

4158,100% Inoffensive Joke,"&gt; I got into an argument with somebody about a joke posted 5 days ago. He insisted the original joke was ruined because this one contained a Russian-speaking KGB agent and a Jewish guy. After a lengthy debate and him refusing to divulge his version of the joke I wrote it for him:

A man who is an agent of an unspecified oppressive dictatorship walks into a library and sees an old man who holds religious beliefs, the exact nature of which is irrelevant.

""What are you reading, old man?"" he asks.

""I'm learning the historically applicable language which was spoken by the progenitors of my faith"", replies the old man.

The government agent asks, ""Presumably the language you are learning is a foreign one, which would not be germane to this conversation except for the fact that our overbearing government regime greatly restricts the travel of its citizens. You will likely die before our autocratic overlords allow you to leave our country of generalized nationality.""

""I am learning this language of my ethnic and religious ancestors, unimportant though their precise historical context may be, so that when I die and am rewarded with the objectively 'good' version of the afterlife I may converse with the pertinent influential figures of my beliefs. It should be mentioned that these same beliefs of mine also include a 'bad' version of the afterlife, which will be a comedically important footnote should this conversation continue in the direction I anticipate,"" replies the old man.

""How do you know that the afterlife to which you will go will be the 'good' one?"" asks the government agent of inconsequential nationality, ""It is my assumption that the tenants of your undeclared faith include some version of an omnipotent judicial character who will determine the fate of your soul based upon the morality of your life pre-mortem. What if said character decides that your actions in life are more deserving of an eternity in the 'bad' afterlife?""

The old man replies, ""I already speak the language of this country which, as has previously been mentioned, is an oppressive society of unjust laws and human rights abuses. The implication of this assertion is that the 'bad' version of the afterlife will in some manner mirror the culture and practices of my homeland. As you are an agent of this government, who is tasked with carrying out the persecutory will of those in charge, you will likely reaffirm my declaration by having me in some way punished for my stigmatization of this nation.""

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''

4912,"A guy asks someone, ‚Äúwhat is a tree?‚Äù.","
They respond, ‚ÄúIn botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.[1]

A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.

Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones. Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead.

Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.

Although ""tree"" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally recognised precise definition of what a tree is, either botanically or in common language.[2] In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the general form of an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.[3] Trees are also typically defined by height,[4] with smaller plants from 0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called shrubs,[5] so the minimum height of a tree is only loosely defined.[4] Large herbaceous plants such as papaya and bananas are trees in this broad sense.[2][6]

A commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a woody trunk formed by secondary growth, meaning that the trunk thickens each year by growing outwards, in addition to the primary upwards growth from the growing tip.[4][7] Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as palms, bananas and papayas are not considered trees regardless of their height, growth form or stem girth. Certain monocots may be considered trees under a slightly looser definition;[8] while the Joshua tree, bamboos and palms do not have secondary growth and never produce true wood with growth rings,[9][10] they may produce ""pseudo-wood"" by lignifying cells formed by primary growth.[11] Tree species in the genus Dracaena, despite also being monocots, do have secondary growth caused by meristem in their trunk, but it is different from the thickening meristem found in dicotyledonous trees.

Aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use; for instance, as those plants which yield lumber.

The tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in different groups of plants: by growing taller, trees are able to compete better for sunlight.[14] Trees tend to be tall and long-lived,[15] some reaching several thousand years old.[16] Several trees are among the oldest organisms now living.[17] Trees have modified structures such as thicker stems composed of specialised cells that add structural strength and durability, allowing them to grow taller than many other plants and to spread out their foliage. They differ from shrubs, which have a similar growth form, by usually growing larger and having a single main stem;[5] but there is no consistent distinction between a tree and a shrub,[18] made more confusing by the fact that trees may be reduced in size under harsher environmental conditions such as on mountains and subarctic areas. The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example of parallel evolution. With an estimated 60,000-100,000 species, the number of trees worldwide might total twenty-five per cent of all living plant species.[19][20] The greatest number of these grow in tropical regions and many of these areas have not yet been fully surveyed by botanists, making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.[21]


The majority of tree species are angiosperms. There are about 1000 species of gymnosperm trees,[22] including conifers, cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales; they produce seeds which are not enclosed in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones, and many have tough waxy leaves, such as pine needles.[23] Most angiosperm trees are eudicots, the ""true dicotyledons"", so named because the seeds contain two cotyledons or seed leaves. There are also some trees among the old lineages of flowering plants called basal angiosperms or paleodicots; these include Amborella, Magnolia, nutmeg and avocado,[24] while trees such as bamboo, palms and bananas are monocots.

Wood gives structural strength to the trunk of most types of tree; this supports the plant as it grows larger. The vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. Trees, as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die.[25] The three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.[26]

Trees are either evergreen, having foliage that persists and remains green throughout the year,[27] or deciduous, shedding their leaves at the end of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage.[28] Most conifers are evergreens, but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis.[5] The crown is the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves,[29] while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy.[30] A sapling is a young tree.[31]

Many tall palms are herbaceous[32] monocots; these do not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood.[9][10] In many tall palms, the terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to 20 metres (66 ft), but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.

In cool temperate regions, conifers often predominate; a widely distributed climax community in the far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest).[39][40] Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover.[41] The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover and there may be little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound.[42] Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.[43]

Where rainfall is relatively evenly spread across the seasons in temperate regions, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest typified by species like oak, beech, birch and maple is found.[44] Temperate forest is also found in the southern hemisphere, as for example in the Eastern Australia temperate forest, characterised by Eucalyptus forest and open acacia woodland.[45]

In tropical regions with a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier part of the year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous.[46] In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such areas.[47]

The roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground and gather water and nutrients to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch out of the side of this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as mangroves and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.[48]

In the soil, the roots encounter the hyphae of fungi. Many of these are known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish in the absence of its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus, while the fungus obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree.[49] The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients and signals from one place to another.[50] The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues.[51] Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.[52]


Buttress roots of the kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra)
Some trees such as the alders (Alnus species) have a symbiotic relationship with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive.[53] The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.[54]

It has been demonstrated that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.[55]

The roots are, generally, an underground part of the tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, to contribute to the mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud.[56] A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan.[57] Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from the lower part of the trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.[58]

Some tree species have developed root extensions that pop out of soil, in order to get oxygen, when it is not available in the soil because of excess water. These root extensions are called pneumatophores, and are present, among others, in black mangrove and pond.

Many tall palms are herbaceous[32] monocots; these do not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood.[9][10] In many tall palms, the terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to 20 metres (66 ft), but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.

The majority of tree species are angiosperms. There are about 1000 species of gymnosperm trees,[22] including conifers, cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales; they produce seeds which are not enclosed in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones, and many have tough waxy leaves, such as pine needles.[23] Most angiosperm trees are eudicots, the ""true dicotyledons"", so named because the seeds contain two cotyledons or seed leaves. There are also some trees among the old lineages of flowering plants called basal angiosperms or paleodicots; these include Amborella, Magnolia, nutmeg and avocado,[24] while trees such as bamboo, palms and bananas are monocots.

Wood gives structural strength to the trunk of most types of tree; this supports the plant as it grows larger. The vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. Trees, as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die.[25] The three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.[26]

In cool temperate regions, conifers often predominate; a widely distributed climax community in the far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest).[39][40] Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover.[41] The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover and there may be little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound.[42] Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.[43]

Where rainfall is relatively evenly spread across the seasons in temperate regions, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest typified by species like oak, beech, birch and maple is found.[44] Temperate forest is also found in the southern hemisphere, as for example in the Eastern Australia temperate forest, characterised by Eucalyptus forest and open acacia woodland.[45]

In tropical regions with a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier part of the year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous.[46] In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such areas.[47]

The roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground and gather water and nutrients to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch out of the side of this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as mangroves and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.[48]

In the soil, the roots encounter the hyphae of fungi. Many of these are known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish in the absence of its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus, while the fungus obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree.[49] The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients and signals from one place to another.[50] The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues.[51] Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.[52]


Buttress roots of the kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra)
Some trees such as the alders (Alnus species) have a symbiotic relationship with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive.[53] The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.[54]

It has been demonstrated that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.[55]

The roots are, generally, an underground part of the tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, to contribute to the mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud.[56] A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan.[57] Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from the lower part of the trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.[58]

Some tree species have developed root extensions that pop out of soil, in order to get oxygen, when it is not available in the soil because of excess water. These root extensions are called pneumatophores, and are present, among others, in black mangrove and pond.

4964,There once was a boy,"There once was a boy named Gimmesome Roy. He was nothing like me or you.
‚ÄôCause laying back and getting high was all he cared to do.
As a kid, he sat in the cellar, sniffing airplane glue.
And then he smoked bananas ‚Äì‚Äì which was then the thing to do.
He tried aspirin in Coca‚ÄìCola, breathed helium on the sly,
And his life was just one endless search to find that perfect high.
But grass just made him want to lay back and eat chocolate‚Äìchip pizza all night,
And the great things he wrote while he was stoned looked like shit in the morning light.
And speed just made him rap all day, reds just laid him back,
And Cocaine Rose was sweet to his nose, but the price nearly broke his back.
He tried PCP and THC, but they didn‚Äôt quite do the trick,
And poppers nearly blew his heart and mushrooms made him sick.
Acid made him see the light, but he couldn‚Äôt remember it long.
And hashish was just a little too weak, and smack was a lot too strong,
And Quaaludes made him stumble, and booze just made him cry,
Till he heard of a cat named Baba Fats who knew of the perfect high.

Now, Baba Fats was a hermit cat who lived up in Nepal,
High on a craggy mountaintop, up a sheer and icy wall.
""But hell,"" says Roy, ""I‚Äôm a healthy boy, and I‚Äôll crawl or climb or fly,
But I‚Äôll find that guru who‚Äôll give me the clue as to what‚Äôs the perfect high.""
So out and off goes Gimmesome Roy to the land that knows no time,
Up a trail no man could conquer to a cliff no man could climb.
For fourteen years he tries that cliff, then back down again he slides
Then sits ‚Äì‚Äì and cries ‚Äì‚Äì and climbs again, pursuing the perfect high.
He‚Äôs grinding his teeth, he‚Äôs coughing blood, he‚Äôs aching and shaking and weak,
As starving and sore and bleeding and tore, he reaches the mountain peak.
And his eyes blink red like a snow‚Äìblind wolf, and he snarls the snarl of a rat,
As there in perfect repose and wearing no clothes ‚Äì‚Äì sits the godlike Baba Fats.

""What‚Äôs happening, Fats?"" says Roy with joy, ""I‚Äôve come to state my biz.
I hear you‚Äôre hip to the perfect trip. Please tell me what it is.
For you can see,"" says Roy to he, ""that I‚Äôm about to die,
So for my last ride, Fats, how can I achieve the perfect high?""
""Well, dog my cats!"" says Baba Fats. ""here‚Äôs one more burnt‚Äìout soul,
Who‚Äôs looking for some alchemist to turn his trip to gold.
But you won‚Äôt find it in no dealer‚Äôs stash, or on no druggist‚Äôs shelf.
Son, if you would seek the perfect high ‚Äì‚Äì find it in yourself.""

""Why, you jive motherfucker!"" screamed Gimmesome Roy, ""I‚Äôve climbed through rain and sleet,
I‚Äôve lost three fingers off my hands and four toes off my feet!
I‚Äôve braved the lair of the polar bear and tasted the maggot‚Äôs kiss.
Now, you tell me the high is in myself. What kind of shit is this?
My ears ‚Äôfore they froze off,"" says Roy, ""had heard all kind of crap,
But I didn‚Äôt climb for fourteen years to listen to that sophomore rap.
And I didn‚Äôt crawl up here to hear that the high is on the natch,
So you tell me where the real stuff is or I‚Äôll kill your guru ass!""

""Ok, OK,"" says Baba Fats, ""you‚Äôre forcing it out of me.
There is a land beyond the sun that‚Äôs known as Zaboli.
A wretched land of stone and sand where snakes and buzzards scream,
And in this devil‚Äôs garden blooms the mystic Tzu‚ÄìTzu tree.
And every ten years it blooms one flower as white as the Key West sky,
And he who eats of the Tzu‚ÄìTzu flower will know the perfect high.
For the rush comes on like a tidal wave and it hits like the blazing sun.
And the high, it lasts a lifetime and the down don‚Äôt ever come.
But the Zaboli land is ruled by a giant who stands twelve cubits high.
With eyes of red in his hundred heads, he waits for the passers‚Äìby.
And you must slay the red‚Äìeyed giant, and swim the River of Slime,
Where the mucous beasts, they wait to feast on those who journey by.
And if you survive the giant and the beasts and swim that slimy sea,
There‚Äôs a blood‚Äìdrinking witch who sharpens her teeth as she guards that Tzu‚ÄìTzu tree.""
""To hell with your witches and giants,"" laughs Roy. ""To hell with the beasts of the sea.
As long as the Tzu‚ÄìTzu flower blooms, some hope still blooms for me.""
And with tears of joy in his snow‚Äìblind eye, Roy hands the guru a five,
Then back down the icy mountain he crawls, pursuing that perfect high.

""Well, that is that,"" says Baba Fats, sitting back down on his stone,
Facing another thousand years of talking to God alone.
""It seems, Lord"", says Fats, ""it‚Äôs always the same, old men or bright‚Äìeyed youth,
It‚Äôs always easier to sell them some shit than it is to give them the truth.""

5011,Peter,"So one night last week I was in a local bar. It was a quiet evening and there were only a few people there.I sit down at the bar and ask for a Scotch on the rocks. As the bar tender prepares my drink I look around me.At the other end of the bar I see a frail and grizzled old man staring absent-mindedly into a half drank whiskey.I grab my now finished drink and walk over to the man and we begin to talk. The man introduces himself as Peter. Now Peter had a strong accent which I couldn't place and eventually curiosity got the better of me. I ask him, ""Peter where are you from? I can't place your accent"". Peter looks solemn and says to me, ""That is quite alright son my accent comes from a couple of places. To be honest with you it would be easier to start at the beginning.""""When I was born I lived in Switzerland on a small farm with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters. When I turned 14 it was an especially cold winter and my older sister Anjelika caught a really bad fever. My parents did all they could, but the nearest hospital was over 2 hours away. By the time they brought her there she had gone unresponsive and passed away. My poor mother couldn't handle the loss and convinced my father to move us into a large city so this would never happen again. Spring rolled in and my parents moved us from our farm into Berlin. Now my father was a hard worker, but times were tough. He eventually found a job at a mill where he worked for hours everyday. What time he didn't work he slept and even this was barely enough to get by. My mother bless her heart tried to help our father, but these were different times and women couldn't find work. So my dear mother did tricks out on the streets to get what little money she could. It was enough to keep us from starving, but not by much. A few years pass and I grew to be a strong young man. At 18 years old I was in prime shape. Then war broke out...My older brother Michael and myself were drafted into the war machine. Before we knew it they had us tearing into France.

It was a quiet evening and there were only a few people there.I sit down at the bar and ask for a Scotch on the rocks. As the bar tender prepares my drink I look around me.At the other end of the bar I see a frail and grizzled old man staring absent-mindedly into a half drank whiskey.I grab my now finished drink and walk over to the man and we begin to talk. The man introduces himself as Peter. Now Peter had a strong accent which I couldn't place and eventually curiosity got the better of me. I ask him, ""Peter where are you from? I can't place your accent"". Peter looks solemn and says to me, ""That is quite alright son my accent comes from a couple of places. To be honest with you it would be easier to start at the beginning.""""When I was born I lived in Switzerland on a small farm with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters. When I turned 14 it was an especially cold winter and my older sister Anjelika caught a really bad fever. My parents did all they could, but the nearest hospital was over 2 hours away. By the time they brought her there she had gone unresponsive and passed away. My poor mother couldn't handle the loss and convinced my father to move us into a large city so this would never happen again. Spring rolled in and my parents moved us from our farm into Berlin. Now my father was a hard worker, but times were tough. He eventually found a job at a mill where he worked for hours everyday. What time he didn't work he slept and even this was barely enough to get by. My mother bless her heart tried to help our father, but these were different times and women couldn't find work. So my dear mother did tricks out on the streets to get what little money she could. It was enough to keep us from starving, but not by much. A few years pass and I grew to be a strong young man. At 18 years old I was in prime shape. Then war broke out...My older brother Michael and myself were drafted into the war machine. Before we knew it they had us tearing into France. I still remember the looks of horror as my platoon fired at the civilians. Like wheat before a scythe they fell. Soon their cries were replaced by eerie silence. My poor brother couldn't handle it and after 3 months he put a bullet in his head.Another couple years go by and it is 1945. Suddenly I hear about the atomic bomb in Japan, then the second one.

5431,Why I fired my secretary (LONG),"Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday.""

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.""

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?""

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"". And I just sat there...

On the couch...

Sobbing...

I was so happy, I couldn't control myself!

""I can't believe you thought we forgot your birthday!"", my wife exclaimed.  ""You should have seen your face this morning.  It took every bit of willpower for me and the kids to not bust out laughing.  Jane and I have been planning this for weeks.""

We spent the next hour and a half opening presents, eating cake, and drinking punch.  It was the most fabulous time I had in quite a while.  After we were done, I asked Jane to come back to the office with me to take care of a couple of things, and told everybody else to take the rest of the afternoon off.

When we got back to the office, I asked Jane to come into my office.

""Please, have a seat, Jane""

""What's up, boss?""

""I checked the petty cash box this morning and saw a receipt for Anna's Bakery for $85.79.  Care to explain this?""

""That's for your birthday cake, boss!  I didn't think you'd mind""

""We've talked about this before, Jane.  Petty Cash is to be used for business expenses only.  Do you remember that baby shower fiasco last year?""

""But....it was for *your* birthday""

5762,*Knock knock* ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù,"‚ÄúThis is a home invasion! Everyone, get on the ground!‚Äù

Two masked men enter Jeffrey‚Äôs home, armed with assault rifles. Jeffrey, his wife, and two children are in the living room. The intruders, begin to tie up Jeffrey and his family, one by one. The entire family is in an immediate state of panic. Jeffrey, who understands that meeting the robbers‚Äô demands is the main priority at this point, tells his wife and kids to just be quiet and let the men get what they want. 

‚ÄúTell that bitch to shut the fuck up!‚Äù The robber screams, Jeffrey‚Äôs wife is in a hysterical state. The robber points his gun at her face. She cowers in fear and begins to cry more.

‚ÄúLinda, please! Just stay calm! Let‚Äôs just give them what the want!‚Äù Jeffrey exclaims. 

‚ÄúAlright, where‚Äôs the money?‚Äù

‚ÄúOur wallets are on the kitchen counter, I have another $200 in my nightstand, first door on your left on the second floor!‚Äù

One robber proceeds to collect the cash while the other one stays downstairs to make sure nobody tries to escape, he is sure to keep his gun pointed at the family to keep them intimidated. 

‚ÄúWhat else you got?‚Äù The robber screams as he comes downstairs. 

‚ÄúI swear that‚Äôs all we have!‚Äù Jeff pleads.

The other robber points his gun directly at Jeff‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúYou sure? Because if I find out you‚Äôre lying I‚Äôll blow your brains out!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, there might be some change in the kitchen drawer!‚Äù 

The robbers go into the kitchen, and rummage through the drawers. They find a couple dollars worth of change. Not much, but given that they are opiod addicts, there is no amount of cash they aren‚Äôt willing to take to contribute towards their next fix.

The robbers re-enter the living room to find the entire family, still lying on the floor tied up, and cowering in fear. The young children are hysterically crying. Jeffrey is trying hardest to maintain his cool, but it is clearly evident that on the inside he is freaking out and concerned for the safety of his family.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù says one of the robbers, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the keys to the Toyota?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey should be on the coffee table, if not, check my jacket pocket, the black coat hanging in the closet.‚Äù

The robbers check the table and are unable to find the keys. One of them goes to the coat closet and quickly locates them. 

‚ÄúAlright, stay on the ground. Do not get up!‚Äù The robber shouts, pointing his gun at the family one last time to ensure they understand the gravity of the situation.

The two masked men flee in the family‚Äôs Toyota. Shortly after, Jeff manages to untie himself and call 911. The police arrive promptly. The family is shaken up from the ordeal, but they describe the robbers to the best of their ability. Unfortunately they were both wearing gloves so they did not leave any fingerprints, and their faces were well concealed from the masks. The police issue an APB for the Toyota, but by now the robbers made it out of town.

The robbers quickly drive to the local drug den, and purchase heroin with their findings. At this point they are already in withdrawal and are quite sick. They park in a nearby lot, and proceed to shoot up. The batch happened to be cut with a large amount of fentanyl, and one of the robbers quickly begins to overdose. His friend begins to panic, knowing that he cannot get help because they just committed an armed robbery and are in a stolen vehicle. Unsure of what to do, he ditches the car, takes all the heroin and leaves his friend to die.

The following morning, the car is located. Police ID the other robber based on DNA and circumstantial evidence. A warrant is issued for his arrest. He goes into hiding, but due to his low intelligence and his inability to stay sober, he is caught within a few weeks. He is sentenced to 10 years in prison, and must serve 85% of that sentence due to state mandatory minimums. Considering he was facing up to 20 years, he didn‚Äôt get off that badly.

In the weeks following, both of the children have been suffering PTSD from the robbery. Jeffrey and Linda seek help from a therapist to help them cope with it. While the family is certainly traumatized from the event, they understand that no amount of money is worth the lives of their loved ones. They are just happy to have each other, and now hug each other a little tighter before they go to bed at night. Jeffrey installed a home security system that included door/window alarms and surveillance cameras, with hope of preventing a similar incident from happening again and endangering his family.",AntiJokes,1586929679,MEJakeCos,4,25,True,"*Knock knock* ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a home invasion!

‚ÄúOur wallets are on the kitchen counter, I have another $200 in my nightstand, first door on your left on the second floor!‚Äù

One robber proceeds to collect the cash while the other one stays downstairs to make sure nobody tries to escape, he is sure to keep his gun pointed at the family to keep them intimidated. 

‚ÄúWhat else you got?‚Äù The robber screams as he comes downstairs. 

‚ÄúI swear that‚Äôs all we have!‚Äù Jeff pleads.

The other robber points his gun directly at Jeff‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúYou sure? Because if I find out you‚Äôre lying I‚Äôll blow your brains out!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, there might be some change in the kitchen drawer!‚Äù 

The robbers go into the kitchen, and rummage through the drawers. They find a couple dollars worth of change. Not much, but given that they are opiod addicts, there is no amount of cash they aren‚Äôt willing to take to contribute towards their next fix.

The robbers re-enter the living room to find the entire family, still lying on the floor tied up, and cowering in fear. The young children are hysterically crying. Jeffrey is trying hardest to maintain his cool, but it is clearly evident that on the inside he is freaking out and concerned for the safety of his family.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù says one of the robbers, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the keys to the Toyota?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey should be on the coffee table, if not, check my jacket pocket, the black coat hanging in the closet.‚Äù

The robbers check the table and are unable to find the keys. One of them goes to the coat closet and quickly locates them. 

‚ÄúAlright, stay on the ground. Do not get up!‚Äù The robber shouts, pointing his gun at the family one last time to ensure they understand the gravity of the situation.

The two masked men flee in the family‚Äôs Toyota. Shortly after, Jeff manages to untie himself and call 911. The police arrive promptly. The family is shaken up from the ordeal, but they describe the robbers to the best of their ability. Unfortunately they were both wearing gloves so they did not leave any fingerprints, and their faces were well concealed from the masks. The police issue an APB for the Toyota, but by now the robbers made it out of town.

The robbers quickly drive to the local drug den, and purchase heroin with their findings. At this point they are already in withdrawal and are quite sick. They park in a nearby lot, and proceed to shoot up. The batch happened to be cut with a large amount of fentanyl, and one of the robbers quickly begins to overdose. His friend begins to panic, knowing that he cannot get help because they just committed an armed robbery and are in a stolen vehicle. Unsure of what to do, he ditches the car, takes all the heroin and leaves his friend to die.

The following morning, the car is located. Police ID the other robber based on DNA and circumstantial evidence. A warrant is issued for his arrest. He goes into hiding, but due to his low intelligence and his inability to stay sober, he is caught within a few weeks. He is sentenced to 10 years in prison, and must serve 85% of that sentence due to state mandatory minimums. Considering he was facing up to 20 years, he didn‚Äôt get off that badly.

In the weeks following, both of the children have been suffering PTSD from the robbery. Jeffrey and Linda seek help from a therapist to help them cope with it. While the family is certainly traumatized from the event, they understand that no amount of money is worth the lives of their loved ones. They are just happy to have each other, and now hug each other a little tighter before they go to bed at night. Jeffrey installed a home security system that included door/window alarms and surveillance cameras, with hope of preventing a similar incident from happening again and endangering his family."
